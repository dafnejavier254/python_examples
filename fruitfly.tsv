1	Fruit flies evolve faster because idk	1
2	I can't explain myself.	1
3	i chose	1
4	i do not	1
5	i dont know	1
6	i dont know	1
7	i just gesst	1
8	idk	1
9	It just makes sense	1
10	NEITHER!	1
11	They reproduce faster.	1
12	Because they have more times to evolve than the elephants do.	2
13	Fruit flies, because their generations pass much faster.	2
14	1000 generations of selective pressure is what it takes to evolve, if there is no selective pressure, the elephant might evolve quicker, say they had selective pressure.	
2
15	36 times a year is faster than once every five times a year.	2
16	36 times a year thats much more than once 5 years.	2
17	According to theory, the elephants will evolve faster, because they will die first, and give theirselves a chance to evolve.	2
18	an elephant can gather alot more traits in 5 years.	2
19	beause there smaller	2
20	becau2se fruit flies die a lot and not that meany elephants die	2
21	because 36 is more than five years it takes longer	2
22	because 36 more than 5.	2
23	because different things can evolve with the fruit fly	2
24	Because elephants are heavier and cant move so much and can't bend down but fruit flies can just sit on fruits and eat	2
25	Because Elephants have been around for so long I don't think that they will be evolvinvg any time soon.	2
26	Because elephants only have kids every 5 years and the Fruit Fly lives for 24 hours and reproduces in that time.	2
27	because elephants take longer and evolution has longer time to evolve but on the other hand fruit flies reproduce very quickly and would not be able to reproduce.	2
28	Because evolution occurs over the generations, so if a fruit fly has small wings but it needs to be able to fly faster, then it's offspring might have larger wings.	2
29	because fruit flies 36 times and theres only 1 elephant every 5 years	2
30	because fruit flies are thaking all the pallen	2
31	because fruit flies are skinnyer and faster while elepants are slower	2
32	because fruit flies are smaller and easier	2
33	because fruit flies are smaller and easyer to evolve	2
34	because fruit flies have a higher chance of dieng when they are born cause predators can eat the as a elephants parents protect it.	2
35	Because fruit flies live for a day and elephants can live for years and years.	2
36	Because fruit flies live for a day and elephants can live for years.	2
37	Because fruit flies live for about one day and elephants can live for many years.	2
38	Because fruit flies only reproduce 36 time a year while elephants only reproduce only one every five years.	2
39	Because fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year	2
40	because fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year while elephant reproduce once every year so i think fruit flies evolve a lot faster cause they reproduce 36 times a year.	2
41	because if there more of the population it can evolve faster	2
42	because if they reproduce 36 times a year they would evolve faster.	2
43	Because it reproduce 36 times a year which is more than once every 5 years.	2
44	because it takes a longer process which would give it more time to evolve.	2
45	because it will have more time me to change	2
46	Because it will share their traits into their offspring.	2
47	Because of how septet it is	2
48	Because of the amount breeding of the fruit fly, they have more chances of evolving.	2
49	Because since the fruit flies reproduce more, they have more chances to gain new traits from their surroundings.	2
50	Because slight evolution occurs in every generation of a species.	2
51	because the elelphant is bigger	2
52	Because the elephant are bigger than the fruit flies.	2
53	because the elephants get bigger every 5 years	2
54	because the flies are smaller and have a greater chance of finding a mate and reproduceing.	2
55	Because the fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year over 5 times a year (elephants)	2
56	because the fruit flies would reproduce every 36 times a year and the elephant would only reproduce every 5 years and the less elephants the less there are to evolve faster.	2
57	BECAUSE THE FRUIT FLIS ARE INSECTS BUT ELEPHANTS ARENT INSECTS BECAUSE THEIR HUGE SIEZE.	2
58	because the fruit fly reproduces 36 times a year and the elaphant only once every 5 years so i think the fruit fly will evolve faster.	2
59	because the have more a better chance of a evolving	2
60	because the more they make the more there is	2
61	Because the only reproduce every 5 years	2
62	because the organism is smaller and takes less time to change.	2
63	because the reproduce about 36 times a year	2
64	Because their are less baby .	2
65	because their little and evolve fatser	2
66	because there are more of them	2
67	because there bigger flies only live for a day	2
68	because there smaller and will become big	2
69	because they are bigger and they dont die as fast as friut flies so they will proble live longer	2
70	because they are small	2
71	because they are small so it takes less longer to evolve.	2
72	because they are small.	2
73	because they are smaller	2
74	because they are smaller and evolve faster	2
75	because they are smaller and over time will get bigger.	2
76	BEcause they are smaller and their DNA is more compatible to evolutions.	2
77	because they are smaller than elephants	2
78	because they are smaller.	2
79	Because they carry diereses	2
80	because they evolve faster then the elephants the elephants reproduce once every 5 years and the fruit flys 36 times a year	2
81	because they get older faster and they will die.	2
82	because they had more time to evolve in there longer life	2
83	because they have faster lifes	2
84	because they have more time than the fruit flies	2
85	because they have more time to notice what could be wrong with them and then they might evolve what seems faster.	2
86	Because they have time to adapt to their surroundings.	2
87	Because they populate less.	2
88	because they produce faster than elephants.	2
89	because they produce less offspringaEU(tm)s.	2
90	Because they reproduce 36 times a year while the elephant only reproduces once every five year.	2
91	because they same time for evoloution	2
92	Because they will have more time to evolve and change before reproducing.	2
93	because they will know what they need and their young will adapt.	2
94	Because, the fruit flies are more smaller and lighter that the elephants.	2
95	becouse they are big	2
96	cause here smaller and they have smaller parrts to evoulte from	2
97	elaphants are fat	2
98	Elefants reproduce less giving them more time to adapt to their environment and evolve better.	2
99	Elephants already have many traits and it evolves once every 5 years. But the fruit fly evolves 36 times a year and is much smaller so it hasn't fully evolved yet.	2
100	Elephants because since they dont reproduce as fast they could adapt to changes unlike the flies reproducing so much theres not enough time to adapt.	2
101	Elephants because their traits will be passed down faster.	2
102	Elephants because there are less of them so they need to learn to survive	2
103	Elephants because they don't reproduce more than the Fruit flies and there are less chances to have more than the fruit flies.	2
104	Elephants because they have a way longer lifespan than fruit flies. Which means there is more time to have an evolutionary trait.	2
105	Elephants because they live longer witch a fruit fly dies like in two days	2
106	elephants because they reproduce every 5 years and probaly more by birthrate.	2
107	Elephants because they will have more time to evolve and gain different traits.	2
108	Elephants because, since their population is so small they could easily grab all the resources they need to survive such as water, food, space, and a environment making it easy to evolve a lot faster.	2
109	Elephants breed slower, so their population is less, and the good traits will be bred in more often than fruit flies.	2
110	Elephants have more human like attributes than fruit flies so they might evolve into humans faster.	2
111	Elephants have more time to adapt to their surroundings and evolve even though they reproduce less than fruit flies.	2
112	Elephants have older siblings and family to help them grow through childhood.	2
113	Elephants have survived longer	2
114	elephants might have more traits that are able to change over time because they carry more traits than flies	2
115	elephants might have more traits that could help it grow/take on more traits that will help it change	2
116	Elephants reproduce less, so they will evolve easily.	2
117	Elephants will evolve faster because it has more time to change and adapt to its envronment.	2
118	Elephants will evolve faster because they will have more time to evolve to their environment if anything happens to the environment.	2
119	Elephants will evolve faster than fruit flies because although there are many more fruit flies than elephants, the elephants will have a longer life and have more of a chance to evolve.	2
120	Elephants will evolve faster than fruit flies because although there are more fruit flies, the elephants will have more time to evolve and change.	2
121	Elephants will have more time to change in their lifetime so that when they finally reproduce the trait will be passed on. Or they will die with a bad trait and it won't be passed on.	2
122	Elephants will involve faster because elephants reproduce about once every 5 years, and the elephants that produce faster will have more kids and pass their traits.	2
123	Elephants, because fruit flies die way more often than elephants.	2
124	Elephants,because they reproduce very slowly, and if one baby's gene is messed up, there won't be really any baby to replace it, so it might evolve to a slightly different specie.But for fruit flies, even if one is messed up, there are a lot of other ones,so the generation will continue on.	2
125	Even if fruit flies reproduce so often, elephants have features that can evolve very easily.	2
126	Even though the elephants take longer to reproduce the fruit flies die everyday, so in the end elephants would win.	2
127	Every time the elephant reproduses the baby will come out diffrent and mabye in the next genarations the reproducing will go faster.	2
128	Fruit Flies, because the more that they reproduce the more that each one will adapt to different places and evolve faster.	2
129	fruit becase they grow 36 times a year and elephants 1 ever 5 years	2
130	Fruit flies are alot smaller then elephants. So evolution is easier to occor.	2
131	fruit flies are flies so it is so possible the flies are faster then an elephant.	2
132	Fruit flies are much faster in flying.	2
133	fruit flies are smaller	2
134	fruit flies are smaller creamers and they are easyer to evolve and change	2
135	fruit flies are smaller so they can evolve and spread faster than elepants	2
136	Fruit flies are smaller so they would have to addapt to thei habbitat	2
137	Fruit flies are smaller than elephants so they require less care and can produce faster because of that.	2
138	Fruit flies are super small.	2
139	Fruit flies are tiny.	2
140	Fruit flies because #6 times in a year is greater than once every 5 years	2
141	fruit flies because the smaller the animal the faster it will evolve and the fly reproduces 36 times a year while the elephant reproduces only 5 times a year.	2
142	fruit flies because there are so many of them they reproduce alot.	2
143	Fruit flies because they are a smaller animal and they move faster than elephants.	2
144	Fruit flies because they are smaller and because they would have to mate a lot to reproduce 36 times a year. To reproduce, they would have to have a partner and that partner could be any kind of insect/ fly. So it would evolve.	2
145	fruit flies because they evolve faste	2
146	Fruit flies because they produce more so then many of them could grow and evolve and look different.	2
147	Fruit flies because they reproduce 36 times a year, and elephants reproduce about once every 5 years.	2
148	Fruit flies because they reproduce so much faster. This gives lots of flies a chance to evolve.	2
149	Fruit flies can multiply two times or more during the elephants five years.	2
150	fruit flies come and leave the community faster than elephants.	2
151	Fruit flies definitely evolve faster because as fruit flies evolve to adapt, the traits learned are passed down to their offspring much faster than elephants.	2
152	Fruit flies dont live very long and you need death in a population for the changes to happen	2
153	Fruit flies evolve much faster, and when both species need to evolve they can do this process through evolution in offspring.	2
154	fruit flies has short life spans, therefore giving them little time to adapt. however, the elephant can live more than 30 years, which gives it plenty of time to evolve	2
155	Fruit flies have 36 chances every year to evolve, while the elephant has only once every five years.	2
156	fruit flies need to evolve to survive because they are small	2
157	Fruit flies reproduce faster, but elephants live longer. That would give them time over each long generation to evolve.	2
158	Fruit flies will evolve faster than elephants because they evolve 36 times a year.	2
159	Fruit Flies will evolve faster, because when more are born, then they have a more likely change to evolve than elephants.	2
160	Fruit flies will reproduce faster because their birth rate is a lot higher than the deat rate, and the elephants reproduce a lot less often.	2
161	Fruit flies will reproduce faster because they are not slow like the elephants are. Fruit flies take a small amount of time to become an adult, unlike the elephant the little baby might take more than a year to be fully grown.	2
162	Fruit flies would evolve faster since they reproduce more giving characteristics they have to more offspring.	2
163	Fruit flies' have a shorter lifetime than a elephant. So the fruit fly would reproduce more.	2
164	Fruit fly's are much smaller and could adapt quicker.	2
165	Fruit flys are smaller and have shorter life spands	2
166	Fruit Flys because if they noticed something bad they have enough generations that would have it so it go down along the line faster.	2
167	Fruitful have more opportunities to evolve than elephants	2
168	fruits flies because when they have a baby a lot more than just one or two will be born.	2
169	has a longer time period to evolve	2
170	i believe that fruit flies will evolve faster because a lot of small animals eat bugs and they don't have a lot of bone dexterity so they are easier to eat and hunt.	2
171	I believe that fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution happens over generations.	2
172	i belive fruit flies evolved faster than elephants because fruit flies are smaller and might not take as much time to evolve as a elephant which has offsprign every five years!	2
173	i choose fruit because they reperdus the fruit	2
174	i choose the elephants because they reproduce every five years and fruit flies reproduce 180 more for every 5 yrs.	2
175	I chose elephants because they reproduce slowly but i think the slower they reproduce the more features they pick up from thy're previous generation.	2
176	I chose fruit flies because if they reproduce 36 times a year, their organisms must affecting them to evolve (maybe even more).	2
177	i chose this because elephants can change more in their longer lifetime and pass it on changing more rapidly and dramatic.	2
178	I feel that the elephant would have a better chance of evolving because the elephants would have a longer amount of life to be able to adapt and evolve to their environment.	2
179	I said fruit flies evolve faster because they are much smaller than an elephant and reproduce 36 times a year and elephants only reproduce 1 every 5 years which is a big difference.	2
180	I said fruit flies, because of how much they produce.	2
181	I think elephants because fruit flies die really fast I think about 2 days is it so they won't really have that chance to have babies and I think elephants because they will need to get faster to water when they travel so I think they will get smaller and faster.	2
182	I think elephants because over time the longer the animal waits to evolve the more it will change while fruit flies evolve 36 times a year and change in tiny incroments elephants save up all the evolutionary trait for 5 years.	2
183	I think elephants because they are bigger and live longer where as fruit flies are smaller and die faster.	2
184	I think elephants because they are larger animals	2
185	I think elephants because they have been around for a while and they are bigger then fruit flies.	2
186	I think elephants because, fruit flies are just really small and stay the same, so I think elephants would have evolved faster.	2
187	I think elephants evolve faster because they are't always reproducing they are evolving faster to.	2
188	I think elephants evolve faster because they reproduce slower.	2
189	I think Elephants will evolve faster because if there is less of them it's easier for them all to change.	2
190	I think elephants will evolve faster because they are easier to find cause they are bigger and Fruit flies are really small insects an its hard to catch them also cause they could fly.	2
191	I think Elephants with evolve faster because they has less babies so more of them can change faster.	2
192	I think elephants would evolve faster because it has more time in between reproduction. If an elephant adapts to its surroundings during a period of 5 years, its offspring will have those adaptations immediately.	2
193	I think fruit flies because elephants only reproduce once every 5 years and fruit flies reproduce 36 every year	2
194	I think fruit flies because they have little to grow and elephants are huge so they have to get all that up there.	2
195	i think fruit flies because they know what to change because it one is not living good they will change to be better	2
196	I think fruit flies because they reproduce 36 times a year while the elephants on reproduces 1 every 5 years	2
197	I think fruit flies because they reproduce faster so they have more chances to evolve.	2
198	I think fruit flies evolve faster because how they are small it might be easier to for them to evolve and they might find new ways to survive faster and get better traits.	2
199	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they are a lot smaller.	2
200	i think fruit flies evolve faster because they have more time to evolve then elephants	2
201	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce about 36 times a year while an elephant reproduces about once every 5 years.	2
202	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce more	2
203	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because each time they reproduce the person will change until a point were the first one will be very different with the last one. They might change to get better traits or to make something better in their life.	2
204	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because if they reproduce 36 times a year,then in that time, they would develop better defenses.	2
205	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it is tiny.	2
206	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it reproduces 36 times a year where elephants reproduce once every five years.	2
207	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because more of them are reproducing faster and the population will increase faster.	2
208	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are smaller and lighter then elephants so it will take less time.	2
209	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are tiny.	2
210	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce pretty fast and the elephant may die after five years so i'm going for the flies.	2
211	I think fruit flies will evolve faster, because there are more of them that need to survive so they need to evolve quickly in order to survive	2
212	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because one fruit fly reproduces about 36 times a year.	2
213	i think fruit flies would evolve faster because they are alot smaller than elephants.	2
214	I think fruit flies would evolve faster, because it says that fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year and elaphants reproduce only 5 time s a year.	2
215	i think fruitflies because they reproduce alot more than elephants	2
216	I think that because each generation will change a bit. The more they reproduce the more change will be made	2
217	I think that Elephants evolve faster because they learn more traits over the years	2
218	I think that elephants evolved faster because there was less population.	2
219	I think that elephants will evolve faster because fruit flies might take up to much energy to evolve faster than an elephant	2
220	I think that elephants will evolve faster because it takes them a while so them the elephants will be able to get different kinds of traits.	2
221	I think that elephants will evolve faster because they don't repeat their genes as much as the flies, so the offspring will have a more longer, different change.	2
222	I think that elephants will evolve faster because, they reproduce slower, which might mean that they'll become extinct faster, which probably means evolution!	2
223	I think that fruit evolve faster because they're body is a lot smaller which means that its not as hard as to evolve.	2
224	I think that fruit flies evolve the faster because they're body is a lot smaller.	2
225	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because as more flies come about they will think of new and better ways for themselves to live. This will result in evolution.	2
226	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more and can experience more.	2
227	I think that it is elephants because they take longer and because they are lager than fruit flies	2
228	I think that the elephant will evolve faster because elephant will never be able to reproduce as fast as other animals and once the elephants have 5 years for 5 babies the dragon flies have 180 fruit flies in five years.	2
229	I think that the elephant will evolve faster because there is more time to change and adapt to the surroundings.	2
230	I think that the elephant will evolve faster, because fruit flies don't really live that long and elephants live longer i think elephants also because they live longer and don't really get killed by humans like flies	2
231	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because it keeps coming and it gets used to everything in its surroundings.	2
232	I think that the fruit fly will evolve faster because the more they reproduce the stronger they can get and they can learn who to breed with to live longer.	2
233	I think that these will evolve faster because if they mate a lot then one of them must mate with a different kind of fruit fly.	2
234	I think that this will happen because the elephants have more time to develop new traits before they have a baby or they would develop more than one trait over time.	2
235	I think the elephant will evolve faster because it's taking it's time to change and fruit flies change 36 times in a year and elephant eat more then fruit flies...	2
236	I think the flies would evolve faster because the flies are smaller and have a lot of predators.	2
237	I think the fruit flies evolved faster because it evolved 36 times a year and the elephant did it once every 5 years.	2
238	I think the Fruit Flies is faster because 36 times a year is every day.	2
239	I think the fruit flies will because they are able to reproduce faster and they might gain more traits this way.	2
240	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because they went through more rough times that they need to survive from.	2
241	I think the fruit flies will, because they have a lot more chances to evolve than the elephants.	2
242	I think they might evolve faster because they are smaller and its quite easier for them to survive.	2
243	i think they will envole by they will grow and get fater and stronger.	2
244	I think this because fruit flies die a lot per day	2
245	I think this because the elephant will have more time to evolve.	2
246	i think this, because it reproduces slower so it has more time to evoulve	2
247	If evolution happens over generations than the faster the generations grow the faster they evolve	2
248	it gives them more time to change	2
249	it hurts	2
250	it must survive long enough for it to adaped to its enviorment and evolve to be able to survive fruit flies average life span is less than a day	2
251	It only takes an a elephant 5 years to reproduce so that pretty fast.	2
252	It take very long for some one or something to evolve.	2
253	More expansion=more different types	2
254	More offspring means their are more generations, so in 5 years an elephant will have one generation, while a fruit fly will have many, making each fly more adapted to its environment.	2
255	more time	2
256	more time to develope traits to offspring	2
257	more traits are passed down through less amount of offspring	2
258	More varieties of fruit flies could be considered.	2
259	over a slower and longer time span a species can gain more attributes and traits.	2
260	"print>>> ""ALL THAT OFFSPRING!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"""	2
261	Say fruit flies reproduce so much, they will have so much of the same thing that say one of they changed in a way that is beneficial, the rest would not be affected by it. Elephants on the other hand, if they have some change that is beneficial, and reproduce, alot of that animal would be changed. Back to the fruit flies, i am pretty sure they are like bees, where they have a queen who does all the reproducing, so if they want to evolve, the change must happen in the queen.	2
262	Since they are so much smaller and faster than elephants i think that is why.	2
263	since they don't reproduce as fast then there a bigger chance they willl envoled faster, because when reproducing slower they can change more easly.	2
264	smaller	2
265	The 2reason I think its elephants is because even though they reproduce only once every 5 years that offsprings generations that they have could change all their genetics.	2
266	The birthrate is faster than the elephants birthrate.	2
267	the changes go down every generation so fruit flies all the way!!!	2
268	the elephant because it has a longer time period to change then the fruit fly	2
269	the Elephant will evolve faster because it has a longer life period	2
270	The elephants because they take longer to reproduce causing it to evolve more knowledge and adapt more information every once a year or so if anything (like their surroundings/habitat) changes.	2
271	The elephants evolve faster because there's genetic diversity while the over-reproduction of fruit flies, they didn't have much diversity so elephants would evolved faster.	2
272	The elephants reproduce slower but they don't have to do it as often.	2
273	The elephants will evolve faster because their parent's will have more time to evolve in between each elephant baby, causing the baby to get traits faster.	2
274	The elephants would evolve faster because their 'bad traits' would leave faster...	2
275	the fruit flies die much faster than elephants.	2
276	The Fruit Flies have more of a chance to evolve than the elephants.	2
277	The fruit flies will be able to go faster.	2
278	The Fruit flies.	2
279	The fruit fly would have evolved faster due to its mating frequently.	2
280	The Furit fly because it will have more time to make changes to its spieces.	2
281	the more generations that pass the faster the animal will evolve.	2
282	The more of a species created the more natural selection is used.	2
283	the more offspring the higher chance of evolving	2
284	the more things die the faster they will evolve	2
285	The process of natural selection has the chance of happening faster.	2
286	The rate of reproduction states it.	2
287	The reason I think its elephants is because they might reproduce once every 5 years but during that time the environment they live in could change in different ways. Therefore that would make them change so they could get used to their new type of environment.	2
288	The reason why i picked Elephants is, because they have more time to change before they reproduce.	2
289	their climate is constantly changing so they need new features to survive.	2
290	there an type of bug and fruit flies can be much faster then the elephant.	2
291	there are more chances for change	2
292	there are more chances for them to	2
293	There are more chances to pass down traits to the next generation.	2
294	There are more fruit flies causing more posibilities of them evolveing to a differnt species.	2
295	there is alot of genitic diversity.	2
296	there smaller and eat faster	2
297	there smaller witch will make them grow bigger cause there small	2
298	there will become way more Fruit Flies over years.	2
299	There would be less elephants that would evolve and therefore all the elephant s might change while only half of the fruit fly's population has evolved	2
300	They are a much smaller species, being easier to evolve	2
301	They are bigger have tough skin and able to protect themselves.	2
302	they are born faster	2
303	They are small so it may not take as much effort.	2
304	They are smaller	2
305	They are smaller and do not have to change a lot because they are small	2
306	They are smaller and more veriatys	2
307	They are smaller and sometimes can change quickly beccause they need adapt to other things trying to cool or eat them	2
308	They became from Mammoths then into elephents	2
309	They become older during the months not the years while the elephants change during the years.	2
310	they die in 24 hours and they have tons of babyaEU(tm)s	2
311	They evolve faster because a fruit fly is smaller an because they don't live for that long and because the can evolve at a much quicker rate.	2
312	They have a biiger chance of evolution.	2
313	they have more chances	2
314	They have more chances to give birth and evolution happens mostly through birth.	2
315	they have more time to adapt to there surroundings	2
316	They have more time to evolve because there reproduce slower.	2
317	They have more times a year to adapt. If say, their wing size needs to be adjusted, they have 36 generations a year to evolve, while the elephants only have one every 5 years.	2
318	they little	2
319	They might evolve faster because if there's a serious drought and no fruit grows, they might evolve to not needing fruit so much to survive.	2
320	they produce 36 times a year and they are also more comen	2
321	they reproduce a lot faster than the elaphants.	2
322	They reproduce fewer then most things on the planet . if humans hunted them down for their hide and their population droped really far down they would most likely evoulve to survive	2
323	They reproduce more.	2
324	They will evolve faster because they are way smaller so it won't have to change that much.	2
325	They will evolve faster when it changes every month.	2
326	They would evolve faster because they have time to adapt to their surroundings. They would have evolved in that time but, the fruit flies could have not.	2
327	they would have a longer time to evolve	2
328	They would have more time to pass on the traits that they learn in their lifetime quicker.	2
329	To evolve you need time.	2
330	to reproduce faster.	2
331	We should never use Birth Control! Obviously the Elephant knows that!	2
332	Well for one thing fruit flies are way smaller than elephants, so that means that the fruit flies babies or eggs are going to be smaller that the elephant's baby. It also might be harder for the mother elephant to have one baby because of its size.	2
333	Well fruit flies reproduce 36 times and the fruit flies are smaller than elephants.	2
334	well if a fruit fly mates and reproduces its more likely there will be a variation between the babies.	2
335	well its common sense. 36 times a year and 1 time every 5 years. So fruit flies.	2
336	Since they reproduce faster, more changes can be made in a shorter amount of time.	3
337	Because fruit flies reproduce about 36 times a year and elephant only reproduces about once every 5 years. A fruit fly also is smaller than a elephant.	3
338	Fruit flies, because they reproduce more often, evolving and expanding their species and variations.	3
339	Species evolve over generations, and if the fruit flies have more generations, the more likely it is for them to evolve faster.	3
340	The Fruit flies can reproduce 5 times faster than the elephant.	3
341	36 is much bigger than 1 every 5 years while 36 each year so fruit flies.	3
342	36 times a year is faster than once every 5 years.	3
343	a fruit fly because it produces more than the elephants per year.	3
344	A fruit fly evolves faster than an elephant because the fruit fly reproduces 36 times a year while elephants reproduce about once a every 5 years.	3
345	A fruit fly would evolve faster because it reproduces more, so its generations can help the species change, it takes a long time for there to be new generations for elephants, so therefore, fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
346	a species can make a noticeable change every couple thousand generations,if flies have more generations per year then they have more generations and therefore change faster	3
347	A species evolves about every 1000 generations since fruit flies reproduce more often than elephants that 1000 generations will come sooner	3
348	a species that spawns faster evolves faster, variation is more likely to occer over many generations	3
349	As fru3it flies live a short life they can mate many times in a year giving lots of generations to change.	3
350	As fruit flies reproduce faster, there might not be enough food to help them survive and give them energy.	3
351	becaause each has to enheiret the traits that are evolving	3
352	BEcasue since there are more of them only the fittest ones will survive. So since there are more of them they have a better chance of having good unique qualities.	3
353	becasue there are more of them	3
354	becasue with fruit flies they reproduce way more so that means that more generations will come and go, and with more generations that means that they will be able to change/evolve faster unlike the elephant.	3
355	Because they reproduce 36 times which means more fruit flies and they will evolve faster	3
356	Because at the rate the fruit flies are reproducing it is obvious that the fruit flies will be the one that repopulate faster.	3
357	because elephants are more unike	3
358	because every year we get 36 fruit flies and the more the fruit flies population grows. the elephant only reproduces once evry five years so there might be less elephants	3
359	Because evolution happens every time an organism gives birth, so for the fruit flies, evolution occurs much faster than most other animals.	3
360	Because evolution occurs over many generations and if the fruit fly reproduces way more than the elephant then it will evolve much faster too.	3
361	Because evolution takes a certain amount of generations, and fruit flies would have more generations in less time.	3
362	because flies only live for 34 hours so they have to make offspring very fast.	3
363	because fruit flies have babies faster	3
364	Because fruit flies have many generations	3
365	because fruit flies have more offspring I think they evolve faster than the elephants who have to produce about every five years.	3
366	Because fruit flies is smaller so it takes less time to evolve.	3
367	because fruit flies life span is like a week so that means they will evolve more fater.	3
368	because fruit flies produce 36 times every year while elephants don't even reproduce one time in a year.	3
369	because fruit flies produce offspring more so they might change faster then elephants	3
370	Because fruit flies reproduce 36 times and elephants once every 5 years.	3
371	Because fruit flies reproduce about 36 times a year while elephants reproduce about once every 5 years.	3
372	Because fruit flies reproduce faster than elephants, they will evolve faster than elephants.	3
373	Because fruit flies reproduce faster, they would evolve faster because they would have more generations in a shorter amount of time.	3
374	Because fruit flies reproduce more often, more offspring will be given the successful trait every year.	3
375	Because fruit flies reproduce more, the species will evolve faster.	3
376	because fruit flies reproduce so much faster. evolution means change over time. time key word. generations is what it means over time so the faster the generations reproduce the faster the evolve.	3
377	because fruit flies will have shorter generathions so if the elefent grows wings in 100 generathions it will take longer then fruit flies losing wings in 100 generathions.	3
378	because fruit flys produce more and i read/heard that bears can be pregant for about 1 year or something like that.	3
379	because if fruit flies reproduce faster then they can evolve faster because if a fruit fly changes every time it reproduces (lets just say) then there will be 36 changes in a year but for an elephant there would only be 1 change in every 5 years	3
380	Because if fruit flies reproduce so fast, it gives them a better chance of evolving.	3
381	because if you reouce more you evolve faster	3
382	Because in 2 years there will be 73 fruit flies and only 1 new elephant.	3
383	because it reproduces faster than elephants	3
384	Because it takes many generation to evolve so the more you reproduce the more generations there is going to be.	3
385	Because its a smaller creature and may produce lots more offspring and they might produce faster.	3
386	because more fruit flies are hatched in a day than elephants are born in a year.	3
387	Because more generations pass for the animal to evolve.	3
388	because more produced the more likely one will evolve and for evolution to happen some must die and if there is a lot of them and some will surely die then they are more likely to evolve	3
389	because more traits are passed slowly	3
390	Because of a shorter time span then the elephant, the fruit fly has a need to reproduce quicker and this may cause more variation in the offspring.	3
391	because related families of fruit flies like odonata reproduce a lot. And hemoptera reproduce tons faster than elephants	3
392	Because since they are reproducing more, there are more fruit flies so they can evolve faster.	3
393	Because the elephants have less time to evolve, making the fruit flies much faster reproducing, letting them have more time to evolve.	3
394	because the form ofspring faster and smaller	3
395	because the fruit flies make more babies	3
396	Because the fruit flies produce more than an elephant could in 5 years..	3
397	Because the fruit flies produce more they may have a larger varriation of their kind.	3
398	Because the fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year so they could evolve because they reproduce even more and the more they are the faster they might evolve.	3
399	Because the fruit flies reproduce faster.	3
400	Because the fruit fly reproduces faster, it will change more.	3
401	Because the fruit fly reproduces more the different traits will evolve faster than an elephant.	3
402	Because the generations go by much faster and take less time.	3
403	because the more and more that come the more fruit flies will evolve.	3
404	because the more generations you have the faster they will change and adapt to there surroundings	3
405	because the more ofspring the faster the newer type comes out	3
406	Because the more they reproduce the more they will get used to modern day.	3
407	Because the more you produce the faster you evolve because you can pass your good traits down.	3
408	because the reprodce more a year than an elephant	3
409	Because the speed of the reproduction of fruit flies is much faster so then so would the evolution.	3
410	Because their are many more fruit flies and they produce more each year then they will evolve at a faster rate than the large animal, the elephant.	3
411	Because their bodies are smaller than elephants	3
412	Because their smaller.	3
413	Because there are more babies that can change faster because the Fruit fly reproduces faster.	3
414	because there are more of them	3
415	because there are more of them.	3
416	Because there are so many fewer elephants, the elephants would not take as long to evolve, because of the lack of nonevolved mates.	3
417	because there is more fruit files and not so much elephants	3
418	because there is more of a chance to evolve with fast reproduction.	3
419	because theres more generations as the fruit fly reproduces and that could evolve and change with the environment	3
420	because they are bigger animals and easy to spot and fruit flies fly so they cant be caught in anything or no animals can catch them	3
421	because they are reproducing faster so they will probably evolve faster than the elephants	3
422	Because they are smaller.	3
423	Because they breed more so then they are able to change faster than somthing that is only born every 5 years.	3
424	Because they don't live long, they evolve very fast.	3
425	because they get a lot of off spring	3
426	because they give off more offspring	3
427	because they have a short life time.	3
428	because they have faster generations so there is a shorter time it takes for them to evolve	3
429	because they have more babies so more and more fruit flies will get the good trait	3
430	Because they have more generation to change in a year, and I know and use the math.	3
431	Because they have more generations in a year then elephants.	3
432	Because they have more generations/time to develop new traits.	3
433	because they have more kids that might have different traits than the parents so that they can survive.	3
434	Because they have more of themselves to evolve from.	3
435	because they have more offspring	3
436	because they have more offspring	3
437	because they have more to evolve	3
438	because they make more flies	3
439	because they make more than elephates	3
440	because they make new fruit flies more often	3
441	because they produce a lot more and eventually after a little bit the genes from different fruit flies will evolve into something else.	3
442	because they produce more faster.	3
443	because they produce more in the same amount of time. When an elephant reproduces once the fruit flies will have reproduce seven times.	3
444	Because they produce offspring a lot they would get traits quicker.	3
445	because they reproducd more	3
446	Because they reproduce 36 times a year.	3
447	because they reproduce a lot more	3
448	because they reproduce faster	3
449	because they reproduce faster and for often	3
450	because they reproduce faster than elephants	3
451	because they reproduce faster than elephants.	3
452	Because they reproduce faster they would evolve faster. As it reproduces changes could happen and it would evolve.	3
453	Because they reproduce faster, they can will be able to adapt to there environment.	3
454	Because they reproduce faster.	3
455	because they reproduce faster. that means faster evolution.	3
456	Because they reproduce more often so it allows for more change in thew offspring.	3
457	because they reproduce more often which makes more fruit flies.	3
458	because they reproduce more they will change faster for their enviroment.	3
459	because they reproduce more with more chance of their babies getting the evolutionary advantage faster	3
460	Because they reproduce so many times per year, the fruit flies will have a better opportunity to evolve over time.	3
461	"Because they will have more opportunity to reproduce than the elephants. If a fruit fly ""wants"" to pass on a good trait, it will be able to more often."	3
462	Because they will produces faster and will have more of a ability to live.	3
463	Because to make so many in a lifetime the ahve to evlove quickly. I think this because firit fies can die esaily.	3
464	becuase more offsprings can change faster as a group and survive better.	3
465	becuse they do it 36 times a year and elephants only do it 5 times	3
466	becuz there r more variateion in reproduction in frut fly	3
467	cause repodution rate will help them	3
468	Cause the fruit flies will be able to pass down there genes faster and will change faster.	3
469	cause they have more offsprings that will get the trait	3
470	Each fruit fly would have some offspring which would have more offspring. Many changes through genes could have happened.	3
471	elephants because the elephants reproduce once every 5 years and they could be faster	3
472	Elephants don't make as many baby's that could change the species.	3
473	Elephants evolve faster because they have more time to change.	3
474	Elephants take longer to reproduce than flies, making the fruit flies evolve faster	3
475	Even though the elephant population is less than the fruit fly population, elephants live longer and adapt to changes.	3
476	Even though you don't evolve every time you reproduce if you reproduce faster you have a better chance to evolve before the other that is why i choose fruit flies.	3
477	Every 5 years the fruit fly has reproduced 180 time and the elephants has reproduce 1.	3
478	Every generation of animals would be a little more advanced than the previous generation. Because fruit flies reproduce so many times in one year, they have more chances to become more and more sophisticated. Elephants reproduce much slower, so evolution would happen slower.	3
479	Every generation, the organism changes slightly. So the faster the generations come, the faster the change comes. So that is why fruit flies would evolve faster since their species have 36 generations a year while elephants only have a generation every 5 years.	3
480	Evolution can only occur with thousands of generations, and the evolution depends on how fast a species' rate of reproduction is.In order to have many generations at a faster rate, then the species must reproduce at a faster rate.	3
481	Evolution doesn't take a specific number of years but a specific number of generations. If a species reproduces quicker that means it has more generations in a lower amount of time.	3
482	evolution goes faster when species reproduce faster because traits are selected faster	3
483	evolution happens during generations not years so the longer it takes for species to reproduce the longer it takes evolution to occur.	3
484	evolution happens faster when reproduction happens faster	3
485	Evolution happens over 1000 generations which can be in only a couple of years if reproduction is fast enough, so fruit flies would evolve faster than elephants.	3
486	Evolution happens over generations of life, the fruit fly reproduces quicker, so it evolves quicker	3
487	Evolution happens over generations, so the faster the generations, the faster the fruit flies would change.	3
488	evolution happens over many generations so the flies will reproduce faster and evolve faster	3
489	evolution happens over many years and since the fruit flies reproduce faster their species will evolve faster	3
490	evolution happens over thousands of generations. each generation for a fruit fly happens much more often than elephants.	3
491	Evolution happens over thousands of generations. So if a fruit fly can get in 36 generations in one year, it would only take less than 30 years for a change in the species. If elephants get a generation once every 5 years, it would take 5000 years for a change in the species. So the fruit flies would definitely evolve faster.	3
492	Evolution occurs by generation, and there are about 360 fruit fly generations in 10 years, and only about 2 in 10 years in elephant generations. The species with the faster reproduction rate will reproduce faster, therefore evolving faster.	3
493	Evolution occurs over about 1,000 generations. Because of the fruit flies faster reproduction rate they would get to that marker faster than the elephant.	3
494	Evolution occurs throughout about 1000 generations, so if there are more generations being produced evolution may occur at a faster rate.	3
495	Evolution takes about 1000 generations and if they reproduce that fast it would proverbially take less time	3
496	Evolution takes many generations. Fruit flies have more generations every few years than elephants, so they have more generations to evolve from.	3
497	Evolution takes place in a number of decades, and when you reproduce more, the generations go by faster.	3
498	Evolution takes place over many generations so since the fruit flies reproduce about 36 times a year they would evolve much faster than the elephant which reproduces about once every 5 years.	3
499	Evolutions occur over generations so when generations are shorter it takes less time to evolve.	3
500	Evoluton takes place over many generations. The faster the generations are, the faster the evolution is.	3
501	Faster birth rate means that there are more animals that can evolve.	3
502	faster reproduction	3
503	flies because they have a faster birth rate.	3
504	Flies because they have a shorter life so they can evolve quicker.	3
505	flies die in two days	3
506	Flies reproduce thousands of times faster than elephants, making it so that there are many more generations.	3
507	Fruit files reproduce faster that's why they evolve faster.	3
508	Fruit flies because evolution takes a thousand years so the fruit fly will have more opportunities to change.	3
509	Fruit flies because if they reproduce 36 times a year while the elephant only reproduces only once every 5 years, then the fruit flies will definetly grow faster.	3
510	Fruit flies because more times an animal reproduces the bigger the evolution.	3
511	Fruit flies because since they have more babies they have a better chance to evolve.	3
512	Fruit flies because since they reproduce faster they have a better chance to evolve.	3
513	Fruit flies because the flies reproduce 36 times a year and the elephants reproduce every 5 years so the fruit flies could reproduce faster and evolve faster.	3
514	fruit flies because the fruit flies can make generations faster because they reproduce faster.	3
515	Fruit flies because there would be more of them to chance over the short period of time when elephants aren't able to change as quickly.	3
516	Fruit flies because they can reproduce faster so the can evolve fastetr.	3
517	fruit flies because they could reprodose faster then an elephant	3
518	Fruit Flies because they evolve about 36 times a year unlike elephants.	3
519	Fruit flies because they have a shorter life span and have more offspring that an elephant does.	3
520	Fruit flies because they have more offspring so they have more chances to evolve.	3
521	Fruit flies because they produce flies faster so the chance of it becoming different every time is possible.	3
522	Fruit flies because they reproduce 36 times a year over 1 time every 5 years.	3
523	Fruit flies because they reproduce every year and plus it reproduces 36 times while the elephant produces one every five years	3
524	Fruit flies because they reproduce faster	3
525	Fruit flies because they reproduce faster and will gain and pass traits down faster.	3
526	fruit flies because they reproduce faster so they will evolve faster.	3
527	fruit flies because they reproduce faster than elephants	3
528	Fruit flies because they reproduce faster.	3
529	Fruit flies because they reproduce more which means more chance of variation. Animals can't evolve without variation.	3
530	Fruit flies because they reproduce very fast and there might be more of them.	3
531	Fruit flies because when the fruit flies lay their eggs, there is millions of them, So when they hatch there is so many fruit flies from just one mother/the one that produces the eggs.	3
532	Fruit flies breed much faster than Elephants there for there is more times where change can occur.	3
533	fruit flies can evolve faster because they can reproduce more offspring which can evolve	3
534	Fruit Flies can reproduce faster than elephant	3
535	Fruit flies continue to make more a lot faster than elephants there for making improvements on it's body faster.	3
536	Fruit flies could have more off spring in the same time as elephants.	3
537	Fruit Flies develop faster because they develop 36 times a year.	3
538	fruit flies die and reproduce much faster than elephants, so the have more generations to evolve.	3
539	fruit flies die faster so they know to reproduce more because they know they die fast	3
540	Fruit flies evolve 36 times a year and are much smaller so it would need to evolve more. The elephant only reproduces once every 5 years and is already really big.	3
541	Fruit flies evolve a lot faster because they reproduce a lot faster. They grow different features too.	3
542	Fruit flies evolve faster because they don't live to long.	3
543	Fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce faster so there is more generations for them to evolve.	3
544	Fruit flies evolved faster because it reproduces 36 times a year while the elephant does it once in every 5 years.	3
545	Fruit flies have 180 generations in the time it takes an elephant to have a new generation, so more generations means that there is more evolution happening.	3
546	Fruit flies have a better chance of creating offspring with new traits.	3
547	Fruit flies have a better chance of evolving because they have more kids then the Elephant.	3
548	fruit flies have a better change of changing and the evolve faster because the reproduce more often giving each fly they reproduce a chance to change.	3
549	Fruit flies have a faster reproduction rate than elephants and it takes less time for fruit flies to reproduce, therefore fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
550	fruit flies have a short life span allowing generations to go faster.	3
551	Fruit flies have a shorter life span than elephants.	3
552	Fruit flies have alot of babies, but most of them don't survive for that long. With elephants they have less babies both mostly all of the time they survive	3
553	Fruit flies have had more generations to change.	3
554	Fruit flies have many generations in a shorter amount of time, this increases the amount that it can evolve in one year.	3
555	Fruit flies have more babies so they change more quickly.	3
556	Fruit flies have more generations in a shorter amount of time, so they would continue the process of evolution far faster.	3
557	Fruit flies have more offspring, so more of them will die allowing the population to grow much faster.	3
558	fruit flies have more offspring, therefor more generations to faster evolve	3
559	fruit flies have offspring more often meaning more chances to evolve.	3
560	Fruit flies have offspring more often, so good traits are passed on more often.	3
561	fruit flies have short life spans so for them to grow into adults before they die they have to mature very fast. Also female fruit flies can lat many eggs at once while female elephants can only give birth to one offspring.	3
562	Fruit Flies lay a lot more babies faster than elephants a fruit flie makes babies everyday a elephant does it in years.	3
563	Fruit flies lay eggs and they may lay many eggs and if they lay eggs 36 time a year plus there is probably a lot of fruit flies to lay eggs unlike elephants they are mammals which means they don't lay eggs so it means that each female elephant in the world have 1 baby elephant after the next 5 yrs they will be another.	3
564	Fruit flies life spand is much shorter than elephants so they go through genorations fater to and so traits will be passed on faster than the elephants.	3
565	Fruit flies may evolve faster because it reproduces lots of times in a year and the elephant just once, so the flies have a faster rank of evolution.	3
566	fruit flies might evolve faster because fruit flies reproduce faster than a elephant and chanages can occur in every baby.	3
567	Fruit flies might have evolved faster because they would have more generations, every year so their evolution rate would be faster. If they only reproduced every 5 years, the time they'd take to evolve would be around 200 years. But fruit flies would be around 1,000 divided by 36, which is about 118 years.	3
568	Fruit flies produce 36 times a year so an offspring could come along with a genetic difference.	3
569	Fruit flies produce generations more quickly than elephants, which means they will evolve faster if a needed.	3
570	Fruit flies produce more generations in a shorter period of time. This means that the species will change much quicker then the elephants, which produce generations slower.	3
571	Fruit flies produce more off-spring which probably reproduce faster and they will move to more environments more often because they are more capable of moving then the elephants so they would evolve once thy got to a different environments.	3
572	Fruit flies produce offspring more than elephants so they would evolve faster over the generations.	3
573	Fruit flies reproduce a lot faster than elephants.	3
574	Fruit Flies reproduce a lot making there more difference whicch helps them evolve faster.	3
575	Fruit flies reproduce about 36 times a year while elephants reproduce about once every 5 years therefor the fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
576	Fruit flies reproduce faster making evolution work faster.	3
577	Fruit flies reproduce faster so natural selection will occur faster and therefore will evolve faster.	3
578	Fruit flies reproduce faster then elephants because they have a faster traits than elephant.	3
579	Fruit flies reproduce faster which means it can evolve faster.	3
580	Fruit flies reproduce faster, die quicker, and are ultimately smaller than elephants.	3
581	Fruit flies reproduce faster, so the amount of time/generations it takes to evolve/adapt will be faster than the generations/time it takes for elephants to evolve.	3
582	Fruit flies reproduce more because they are small... and they can easily be born and... therefore leaving the point that they can reproduce.	3
583	FRUIT FLIES REPRODUCE MORE OFTEN THAN ELEPHANTS SO THEIR BABIES WILL HAVE MORE OF A CHANCE TO EVOLVE	3
584	Fruit Flies reproduce more than the elephant so the fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
585	fruit flies reproduce more than the elephant.	3
586	Fruit flies reproduce more that elephants do so fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
587	Fruit flies reproduce more, so they change faster.	3
588	Fruit flies reproduce much faster and has many generations. Over those generations, which could just be a couple of years, they could have evolved into something different.	3
589	fruit flies reproduce much more often and if a reproduction goes wrong the reproduction would keep going even with one change in a pattern	3
590	Fruit flies reproduce much more often than elephants so the chance one will be born differently is larger than the chance of an elephant being born differently.	3
591	fruit flies reproduce quickly, making the process of evolution faster. elephants don't reproduce as rapidly, meaning it would take longer for them to evolve.	3
592	Fruit flies reproduce so much more they would have more chances to change.	3
593	Fruit flies reproduce very often, while elephants don't. The fruit flies probably experience time more slowly than elephants. Their species probably changes every fifty or sixty years, unlike elephants who probably take a much longer time to evolve.	3
594	Fruit flies reproducer quicker because they reproduce 36 times while the elephant only reproduced once every year so the flies reproduce faster.	3
595	Fruit flies that reproduce faster so fruit flies would be able to pass on the characteristics that they had gained during their lifetime, but elephants can't reproduce as fast.	3
596	fruit flies they are smaller.	3
597	Fruit flies will be able to evolve faster, because they can go through many, many generations in the time it would take an elephant to go through just a few. And because evolution happens over about a thousand generations, fruit flies would take about 3 years to evolve, and elephants would take about about 5000 years to evolve.	3
598	Fruit flies will because the produce more and a faster rate.	3
599	fruit flies will because they have a lot more chances to evolve by having more of them.	3
600	"Fruit flies will change rapidly b/c the ones who don't survive die and cannot reproduce while the others can and then the get children really fast ( this ""refines"" some of the traits they have while ""excluding"" others)."	3
601	Fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution happens over thousands of generations, and because the reproduction rate for the fruit fly is much higher, it will also evolve much faster.	3
602	Fruit flies will evolve faster because if there is more of fruit flies then they have a better chance of evolving faster.	3
603	Fruit flies will evolve faster because more fruit flies are produced in a year than elephants are.	3
604	Fruit flies will evolve faster because more of them are being born more often than elephants.	3
605	Fruit flies will evolve faster because more of them are reproduced in a year than elephants.	3
606	Fruit flies will evolve faster because the faster they reproduce, evolution happens more quickly.	3
607	Fruit flies will evolve faster because the have progeny faster.	3
608	Fruit flies will evolve faster because the reproduce more often than elephants	3
609	Fruit flies will evolve faster because the reproduce more.	3
610	Fruit flies will evolve faster because their can develop their traits faster and become more suited to their environment faster.	3
611	Fruit flies will evolve faster because their rate of reproduction is faster. Evolution takes thousands of generations to occur, and a thousand generations for a fruit fly is a shorter period of time than a thousand generations for an elephant.	3
612	Fruit flies will evolve faster because there is more of them,so they is a greater chance of evolving.	3
613	Fruit flies will evolve faster because there will be more generations to evolve.	3
614	Fruit flies will evolve faster because there will be more of them.	3
615	fruit flies will evolve faster because theres more generations and reproduction which helps evolution	3
616	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they are a lot smaller than the elephant. The smaller the animal the faster it will reproduce. The faster it will reproduce the faster evolution occurs.	3
617	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they can reproduce faster than the elephants.	3
618	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they evolve 180 times for every one elephant. This gives more that can change faster.	3
619	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have a shorter life span and they have offspring at a faster rate and more at one time.	3
620	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more generations to evolve.	3
621	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more of a chance to give birth to an evolved fruit fly.	3
622	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more offspring which could hold a new item or evolution.	3
623	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce a lot more organisms and not all of them will survive.	3
624	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce a lot more and they can use that to their advantage. If they have a trait one generation the next generation might have it a little better and so on.	3
625	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce a lot more often then elephants.	3
626	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster.	3
627	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster.	3
628	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more than elephants and that means more offspring which means there is more of them to evolve.	3
629	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more than elephants. elephants only reproduce every five years but fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year.	3
630	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more.	3
631	fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce much faster and that means that the fruit flies and if there is difference in the flies the most dominant will survive	3
632	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce much more than an elephant.	3
633	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce quicklier, they need 1 thousand of generations t evolve, they would take a shorter period of time to reach thousands of generations. By the other hand, elephants will take much more time to evolve because they take more time reproducing and going from generation to generation.	3
634	fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce so often they will go through 1000 generations MUCH faster than elephants would.	3
635	Fruit Flies will evolve faster than elephants because fruit flies reproduce so much faster than them.	3
636	Fruit flies will evolve faster than the elephants because the fruit flies reproduce much faster than elephants. This means that the fruit flies will pass many generations quickly, causing evolution to occur faster. The elephant only reproduces only once every five years, so that means the elephant will evolve slower.	3
637	Fruit flies will evolve faster, because if evolution takes 1000 generations, fruit flies will get there in less time that the elephants. It will take them fewer years.	3
638	Fruit flies will evolve more because there are more generations to make traits better.	3
639	Fruit flies will probably evolve faster because they have more chances of evolving because tghey have more offspring that can have the trait.	3
640	Fruit Flies will probably evolve faster because they reproduce faster than the elaphants do which means that there are more being born a yeaar so the traits are changing over time faster.	3
641	Fruit flies will reproduce faster because elephants reproduce slowly. It takes about 1,000 generations for the species to evolve, so it will take fruit flies about 28 years to evolve, whereas it will take elephants 200 years to evolve.	3
642	Fruit flies would evolve faster because evolution happens over many generations so while a fruit flies has 36 generations in a year the elephants have 5 generations in a year. Since fruit flies have more generations in a year they would evolve faster.	3
643	fruit flies would evolve faster because evolution takes place over about 1,000 generations. It would take about 28 years for fruit flies to evolve and elephants would evolve over about 5,000 generation, so the fruit flies would evolve faster.	3
644	Fruit flies would evolve faster because they produce more than the elephant	3
645	Fruit flies would evolve faster because they reproduce faster because elephants reproduce every 5 years.	3
646	Fruit flies would evolve faster because they reproduce quicker, so they can change quicker.	3
647	Fruit flies would evolve faster because they reproduce so much that there generations will go faster. They would be able to change more because they reproduce so much so there time goes by faster.	3
648	Fruit flies would evolve faster than Elephants because it takes many generations of a species to evolve, and since the Fruit Flies reproduce many more times than the Elephant, it would evolve faster.	3
649	Fruit flies would evolve faster, because there would be more and more generations which would each have new, and better traits.	3
650	Fruit flies would evolve more often because they have a generation faster so the evolve more often. Because they have a generation faster they change more often.	3
651	fruit flies would have had more generations in a smaller amount of time, therefore causing for more changes	3
652	Fruit flies would reproduce faster because they reproduce 36 times a year and they evolve over 1000 generations.	3
653	Fruit flies, because it takes 1000 generations to evolve, and fruit flies produce much faster than elephants , so their evolution time is shorter.	3
654	Fruit flies, they reproduce by the thousands and that means more generations which leads to evolution.	3
655	Fruit fly's have more babies then elephants.	3
656	fruit flyaEU(tm)s because they reproduce more them elephants do .	3
657	Fruit flyies because they reproduce way more times a year then elephants so they have a bigger chance of reproducing.	3
658	Fruit flys because they will reproduce so much they notice the bad things and fix them.	3
659	Fruit flys can produce more generations in an equal amount of time then a Elephants.	3
660	fruit flys die very quickly so they will evole	3
661	Fruit flys will defiantly evolve faster because the reproduction rate is much higher with the flys rather than the elephants. By the time an elefant has 5 generations the fruit fly will have thousands if not millions.	3
662	Fruit flys will evolve faster because they reproduce more times a year.	3
663	Fruit will evolve faster than elephants because they reproduce faster. I think that the faster a species reproduces, the faster it evolves or develops more traits.	3
664	fruitflies because they evolve wayyy faster than elaphants and each time they reproduce, they might change a little by gaining a diseiese or something. thats why there must be a lot of different types of fruitflies. Species i mean.	3
665	fruitflies because they reproduce wayyyy more than elephants and they'll probably change some of their features as well in the many years fruitflies have lived and reproduce.	3
666	frult flis reprodce more thin elephants because they ned more of there spices.	3
667	Fuit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster and can adapt to they're edviorment alot faster than the elephants who only reproduce i time every 5 years.	3
668	having many children increases the population of successfully evolved organisms that managed to survive for longer; therefore, evolution would move more quickly.	3
669	I believe fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce so much faster than elephants so that means when they gain traits to help them survive better it will go to the next generation so much faster.	3
670	I believe that every generation, the species is slowly changing. So the faster you reproduce, the faster change will come to the species which is basically what evolution is all about. So I think that fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
671	I believe that fruit flies will evolve faster because they are constantly reproducing, which is making more generations to keep going by, which is causing more changes in that time.	3
672	I believe that fruit flies will evolve faster since they have short life spans and they reproduce more frequently.	3
673	I believe that slower reproduction yields the rate of evolution. If their is more chance for variance in the genetic makeup the species will evolve much quicker.	3
674	I believe that the fruit flies evolve faster because organisms change when they are born not during their lifetime. Genetic traits are not passed down so the fruit fly has much more opportunites to evolve.	3
675	I believe the fruit flies will evolve faster because they repreduce more and that gives them a better change to evolve because the many babies will be able to change a lot.	3
676	I believe the fruit flies will evolve faster than the elephants because they have gone through more natural selection than the elephant.	3
677	I believe the fruit fly because if it reproduces 36 times every year, then it would have much more than the elephant, who would only be at 10 in year two.	3
678	I chose fruit flies because reproducing once every 5 years is very slow and that means fruit flies would of already evolved by then.	3
679	I chose fruit flies because they just keep reproducing and I think that every fruit fly might be a little different.	3
680	I chose fruit flies because they reproduce faster than elephants.	3
681	I chose fruit flies because they reproduce more then the Elephants and would evolve much faster because they reproduce 36 times a year.	3
682	I chose fruit flies because when offspring if born, it changes a little every time. So over time they fruit fly will change or evolve into something different.	3
683	I chose it because they can reproduce really fast so it is more likely to evolve faster	3
684	I chose the fruit flies beause they reproduce so much that they might have had some affect because the fruit flies change and work so much but the elephant just has a normal daily life for 5 years.	3
685	I picked that because it reproduces slower and will evolve faster because of that.	3
686	I picked the the fruit flies because they reproduce 36 times a year which is really fast compared to the elephants only reproduce once every five years.	3
687	I think elephants will evolve faster because elephants have a longer time to adapt. Even though fruit flies reproduce faster, elephants live way longer.	3
688	I think elephants will evolve faster because they will slowly decrease their population. Also,tey don't reproduce as much as the fruit flies.	3
689	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are having more offsprings.	3
690	I think fruit flies because it doesn't take that long to reproduce.	3
691	I think fruit flies because it seems like there would be a much lager chance of the fruit fly evolving faster if it reroduces faster since there are more chances of change.	3
692	I think fruit flies because it takes many generations to evolve and fruit flies reproduce much more so fruit flies would evolve faster.	3
693	I think fruit flies because the are smaller animals and they can produce faster than an elephant would.	3
694	I think fruit flies because the more you have reproducing each year, the more every year. In year 4, the elephants will have 20, while the flies have 144. That is a lot more than 20.	3
695	I think fruit flies because their are more of them. Because they reproduce about 36 time a year unlike elephants.	3
696	I think fruit flies because they are 36 tomes one year.	3
697	I think fruit flies because they have more babies. The more babies you have, the more variation there is.	3
698	I think fruit flies because they reproduce more often.	3
699	I think fruit flies because they reproduce way more than elephants do and they can have more fruit flies.	3
700	I think fruit flies because they're are more of them and there smaller.	3
701	I think fruit flies evolve fast because they are reproducing much more than the elephant and as the grow the will get new traits and evolve faster.	3
702	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they can inherit traits faster than elephants.	3
703	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they produce a greater amount of offspring then elephants.	3
704	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce more offspring than elephants do.	3
705	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce way faster than the elephants.	3
706	I think fruit flies reproduce faster because they produce 36 times a year and elephants only reproduce 5 times a year.	3
707	I think fruit flies will be faster since the fruit flies will be reproducing faster, but the elephant has less time for them to make different generations.	3
708	I think fruit flies will because they reproduce faster.	3
709	I think fruit flies will evolve fast because it produces more than the elephants.	3
710	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution takes many generations. The faster the reproduction rate, the faster they will evolve.	3
711	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because if a fruit fly changes very slightly, and all their offspring change the same amount, it will take less time for the change to develop into a large change. But if an elephant changed very slightly in it's lifetime, it would have to wait a long time before it had enough offspring to develop the change into a big difference.	3
712	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because in order to evolve, you have to reproduce. So if the flies reproduce faster, they can evolve faster.	3
713	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it has a faster rate of reproduction than the elephants.	3
714	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it reproduces more and it could change.	3
715	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it reproduces more times a year that elephants.	3
716	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because of its rate of reproduction. Evolution will show the most after about 1000 generations and, based on the rate of reproduction, the fruit flies will reach 1000 generations faster.	3
717	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because since they reproduce more they adapt faster.	3
718	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because the faster a species reproduces, the faster it evolves. It takes one thousand generations for species to evolve, so it would take fruit flies only a few decades to evolve, while it would take elephants about 5 millenia to evolve.	3
719	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because the more you produce offspring, the more chances you have to evolve.	3
720	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because their is more and more populations being ade which makes it easier for the bugs to evolve, pass on their evolved DNA, then that bug will evolve a little and pass on their DNA very fast because of so many offspring.	3
721	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because their reproduction rate is faster. Evolution happens in 1000 generations and for fruit flies it only takes them around 28 years to achieve that while it takes an elephant 5000 years.	3
722	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because there is more generations that can change were elephants only have one every 5 years to change.	3
723	i think fruit flies will evolve faster because there is more of them producing and they will change over a period of time a lot faster because there is more of them	3
724	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because there is more of them, making it easier to evolve.	3
725	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are constantly reproducing and getting new mixes of genes each time.	3
726	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are smaller and live a shorter life than elephants.	3
727	I think Fruit Flies will evolve faster because they produce more and there is more of them.	3
728	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce more than the elephant does (Fruit Flies: 36 times a year,While the elephant only reproduces 5 times a year) and they evolve faster because they have more of the insect then the elephant does to have more elephants.	3
729	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce more which means more offspring, more offspring means more fruit flies that will live.	3
730	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce more.	3
731	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce 36 times a year and will have more genetic variation faster then an elephant that reproduces once every five years.	3
732	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce about 36 times a year.	3
733	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster than the elephants so they can change faster.	3
734	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster, so they will evolve faster.	3
735	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster. The generations will come faster and change faster than elephants.	3
736	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more, so they have more of a chance of having something happen.	3
737	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce way more offspring than an elephant does and there would be more generations. The fruit flies might change a little bit every generation so they would probably evolve alot faster than an elephant would.	3
738	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they would have more variation.	3
739	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because with a higher birthrate that means there is a higher chance they can change.	3
740	I think fruit flies will evolve faster since it has more chances of dieing and they have more babies.	3
741	I think Fruit Flies will evolve faster than elephants because, the more you reproduce, the more changes will be found in the species.	3
742	I think fruit flies will evolve faster that elephants because evolution occcurs in generations, when a genetic difference happens had is passed onto its offspring.	3
743	I think fruit flies will evolve faster, since they produce more offspring and the traits will change more and evolve more.	3
744	I think fruit flies will evolve quicker because their life time is shorter.	3
745	I think fruit flies will more likely evolve faster because they reproduce more so then changes are more likely to occur within these times.	3
746	I think fruit flies will produce faster because they have more babies at a faster rate, so it gives them a higher change of evolving faster.	3
747	I think fruit flies will reproduce faster because they are making more offspring and then the offspring would all evolve faster than the elephants.	3
748	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because if they reproduce 36 times a year while elephants only reproduce about once every 5 years, the fruit flies would have more chances of evolving because they would keep reproducing and reproducing so they might have selective pressure which could make them faster other other circumstances in which they would need to evolve. If elephants only reproduce once every 5 years then it would take them a long time to evolve because they would not have many offspring.	3
749	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because the fruit flies would change in days and become different. But for elephants, they have a slower reproductive rate than fruit flies and it would take the elephant's offspring a longer time to evolve and change.	3
750	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because they are giving birth more which means each generation there is a very small change and if they made more babies a year they would evolve faster than elephants.	3
751	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because they have more chances to adapt or change in five years that an elephant would have.	3
752	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because they have more generations and they could evolve in a year or two but for elephants they only reproduce once in five years so they have to wait longer to evolve.	3
753	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because they would have more time to adapt than the elephant, if the world was slowly warming than the fruit flies would have a better chance of adapting quicker.	3
754	I think fruit flies would evolve faster if they reproduce more often than elephants.	3
755	I think fruit flies would go=row faster because they produce faster and in bigger numbers which would help alot	3
756	i think fruit flieswill evolve faster cause fruit flies reproduce faster	3
757	I think fruit flyes will evolve faster beacuse they produce faster	3
758	i think that fruit flies can evolve faster because the can reproduce faster and that gives them an advantage to be able to evolve faster.	3
759	I think that fruit flies evolve faster because they have more generations and evalution only accurs over thousand of years.	3
760	I think that fruit flies evolve faster than elephants because they have more babies so then their babies can evolve faster because they are being born more often.	3
761	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution takes place over generations and fruit flies create many generations in a short period of time when elephants create generations much slower.	3
762	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because it only takes 27 years for fruit flies to create 1,000 generations and evolve and for elephants it would take 5,000 years for them to evolve because of their slow rate of reproduction.	3
763	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because of its high population rate and also because of its size it would take a shorter period of time to evolve.	3
764	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because since they are always reproducing, they will pass by a lot of changes and evolve so they can survive better.	3
765	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more, so they have more of a chance to evolve; the faster an organism reproduces, the faster it evolves.	3
766	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because you need more offspring to reproduce since some will die and others will be successful and evolve for the better. Elephants on the other hand only reproduce once every five years so this does not give them enough offspring for evolution to occur.	3
767	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster due to the elephants lack of reproducing.	3
768	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster since they have short lifespans so their offspring will be able to fix it much more quickly than the first generation could. For example, it takes longer for adults to get used to new things such as technology whereas kids can easily adapt to new concepts.	3
769	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster, because since there would most likely be more fruit flies than elephants being born, evolution could effect them more, since there is a better chance of this to happen.	3
770	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster, because they are reproducing more and more, while their babies are also reproducing, adding to the fruit fly population.	3
771	I think that fruit flies will evolve quicker because they're are more and they are a smaller organism who will progress over time.	3
772	I think that fruit flies will reproduce faster because they reproduce faster. The reason that it would make a difference is because if the flies have faster generations then they will evolve faster	3
773	I think that fruit fly evolve faster because they reproduce more and they will have more generations faster.	3
774	I think that fruit fly's will evolve faster cause The have more generations every year than the elephant and therefor they can change faster.	3
775	I think that fruit flys evolve faster because they reproduse more so that there are more of them	3
776	I think that the fruit flies will because they produce more which gives them a better chance for change.	3
777	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because the new adaptions will be produced quicker since more off spring is produced.	3
778	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more offspring then the elephants.	3
779	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more which increases the chance of it changing.	3
780	I think that the fruit fly evolves faster because they reproduce more each year.	3
781	I think that the fruit fly will evolve faster because the fruit fly gets its generations much faster than the elephant.	3
782	I think that the fruit fly would evolve faster because they reproduce faster and change can occur faster.	3
783	I think the fruit flies because it has way more than elephants so it would change way faster.	3
784	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution happens over generations so the fruit fly will have more generations than the elephant over a couple of years.	3
785	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because if the Earth starts warming/cooling then it will have a better chance to adapt quicker.	3
786	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because in order to evolve, you have to reproduce so if the fruit flies are reproducing faster, then they can evolve faster.	3
787	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because they are constantly reproducing causing them to evolve faster than elephants who only reproduce about once every 5 years.	3
788	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because they easily have a better chance of getting different offspring because of the loads they reproduce a year. Also, a four-legged mammal as big as an elephant will obviously take more time to evolve considering the amount of area it carries.	3
789	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster than the elephant.	3
790	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster than the elephants because they reproduce faster.	3
791	I think the fruit flies will produce faster because they reproduce a lot more than elephants do.	3
792	I think the fruit flies would evolve faster because evolution takes about 1,000 generations to fully occur, and for the fruit flies, who reproduce about 36 times a year, that time would be much shorter that the elephants reproduction rate of once every 5 years.	3
793	I think the fruit flies would evolve faster because since it takes them 36 times a year to reproduce and elephant only reproduce once in 5 years. It's more likely that the fruit flies would evolve faster because it takes a animal to evolve 1000 generations. by the time the fruit flies evolve the elephant is probably only half through the process.	3
794	I think the fruit flies would evolve faster because since they reproduce faster, they could maybe change.	3
795	I think the fruit flies would evolve faster because they produce about 36 times a year compared to a elephant that reproduces about once every 5 years. So the chances of a fruit fly having more offspring is better than a chance of a elephant.	3
796	I think the fruit fly will evolve faster because first it is a insect and insects reproduce faster plus they lay a lot of eggs.	3
797	I think the fruit flys because they have a larger reproduction rate there for more chances to evolve to their environment.	3
798	I think the fruitflies would evolve faster because they need food they can't get so they evolve into something so maintain its living conditions.	3
799	I think the more times you reproduce, the more of a variation you are able to get.	3
800	I think they will evolve faster because since they reproduce so often, the newer generations could learn to adapt faster than the elephants because they only reproduce once every five years.	3
801	I think they will evolve faster because they are being produced more and have a higher chance.	3
802	i think they would evolve faster because the reproduce faster	3
803	I think this because if they reproduce faster then they evolve faster.	3
804	if a sp4ecies evolves every 1000 generations the faster you have kids the faster your species will evolve	3
805	if an organism repreduces faster than it has more chances to mix up the DNA and then that causes faster evolution.	3
806	If evolution takes thousands of generations to occur, the fruit fly would evolve much faster than the elephant because of the reduced time gap between reproduction.	3
807	if flies reproduce more they have more of a chance to change	3
808	if fruit flies have more offspring than there will be more chances to evlolve because there are many flies in the species unlike elaphants who have less animals in the species	3
809	if fruit flies produce about 36 babies a year, the babies are more likely to have other kids and those kids could mate with other organisms and produce different kinds of babies. while the elephant only reproduces about every once in 5 years, they probably wouldn't have a lot of variation.	3
810	If fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year they will evolve faster because there will be a bigger population in the species, but if elaphants only reproduce once every 5 years there are less elaphants in the species population so they will be less likely to evolve fast if at all. Elephants still can evolve it will just take much, much longer for them to evolve because of the time they reproduce.	3
811	If fruit flies reproduce more often than elephants, there's a larger chance they'll have offspring that will change their species.	3
812	if fruit flys reproduce faster they would have shorter generations so it would take less time for fruit flys to evolve	3
813	if fruitflies reproduce faster that gives them a chance to change more	3
814	If it takes roughly one thousand generations for a species to evolve then the fruitflies generations would go by faster leaving more oppertunituies for the species to evolve.	3
815	if reproduction goes faster than evolution is sped up.	3
816	If something reproduces more, there is more chance for evolution and more chance to make successful baby fruit flies.	3
817	If the flies die they start to produce more and elephants if a lot die they may not be able to reproduce	3
818	if there are 36 generations in one year there is a larger chance they will evolve	3
819	If they are constantly reproducing there a little changes every time, because the offspring isn't exactly the same as the parent. So evolution is more likely to happen faster to fruit flies.	3
820	If they reproduce faster there is more room for evolvment.	3
821	If they reproduce more often then there will be more fruit flies there for they will evolve fsster	3
822	if they reproduce more, that's more generations and more time to evolved	3
823	If they reproduce much quicker, they must evolve quicker too.	3
824	if you reproduce more then there is more time to chang over time because evolution occors throgh generations not years.	3
825	in 5 years the fruit fly has reproduce 180 times and the elephant only once or twice!	3
826	it is because fruilt flies rebrodis faster thin elphants.	3
827	It doesn't matter how long an organism takes to evolve, only the number of generations do. And since the fruit flies reproduce faster than the elephant, then they can probably make more generations than the elephants. Which results in the fact that the fruit flies will evolve faster than the elephant.	3
828	it evolves faster because it is a smaller specie	3
829	It is because evolution takes hundreds and maybe thousands of generations and since fruit flies reproduce faster, generations will happen faster so evolution will occur faster.	3
830	It is because it will go through generations faster.	3
831	it produces more than than the elephants	3
832	It says in the text that the fruit flys reproduce faster.	3
833	It ta3kes less time to get to 1000 generations if the animal produces more often; the fruit flies produce more often.	3
834	It takes 1,000's of generations to evolve so if the fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year and elephants only reproduce 5 times a year then the fruit flies would reproduce a lot faster.	3
835	it takes 1000 about 1000 generations to evolve it takes the fruit fly 27 years to evolve 200 years so the fruit fly will evovle faster	3
836	it takes 1000 generations , the faster they reproduce the faster evolution will happen.	3
837	It takes about 1,000 generations to evolve, and the fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year, so they will reach 1,000 generations faster than the elephant, which takes 5 years to reproduce once.	3
838	It takes about 1000 generations to see a change and so it would take less time for a fruit fly to evolve.	3
839	It takes about one thousand years for a species to evolve. Because fruit flies evolve 36 times a year, it will only take around 28 years to evolve. Elephants do that every five year, so it will take them roughly five thousand years to evolve.	3
840	It takes an animal 100 generations to evolve, so if a fruit fly reproduced more often than an elephant, the generations would go by a lot faster for the fruit fly.	3
841	It takes approximately a thousand generation for a little change to happen in a species (evolution) and the faster the species mates in a year the faster the species gets to a thousand generations and evolves.	3
842	it takes around 1000 generations for organisms to evolve. each time they reproduce they show small traits to show that they are evolving. each time they have an offspring, that is a new generation.	3
843	it takes lots of generations to evolve so if the fly reproduces 36 times a year it will evolve much faster then the elephant.	3
844	It takes many (1,000) generations for a species to evolve, so the more often the species reproduces, the more generations it will have in that time, and will shorten, or lengthen, the amount of time it takes for them to evolve.	3
845	It takes many generations for a species to evolve so the fruit fly will evolve faster. Say it takes 1000 generations for the fruit fly to evolve, that would only take about 28 years.	3
846	It takes offspring to evolve not years therefor when the fruit flies reproduce faster they will evolve faster.	3
847	It takes thousands of generations to evolve and if you reproduce more generations will go by faster.	3
848	it takes thousands of generations to evolve so the faster your reproduction the more generations you can produce. Therefor, the fruit flies with 36 times a year reproduction will evolve faster due to their fast reproduction rate giving more evolving chances.	3
849	It takes thousands of generations to evolve so the species that creates generations faster will evolve quicker.In this case the fruit flies are reproducing faster so they will evolve faster.	3
850	It takes4 about 1000 generations to see a real change in a species and because in one year there are 36 generations of fruit flies it will take less years than elephants that make another generation every 5 years. So, fruit flies will evolve a lot faster.	3
851	It think fruit flies will evolve faster because of its reproduction rate; if one fly is weird then its kids might be like it.	3
852	it will make the process faster if the organism can reproduce faster	3
853	It would take them less time to reach 1000 generations	3
854	more baby's the more chance of change	3
855	more chance because more offspring	3
856	More fruit flies get born causing it to get inherit more traits that cause it to get more fruit flies that evolve.	3
857	more generaions	3
858	more generations	3
859	more generations	3
860	More generations = More variety over time	3
861	More generations give more places to add new traits.	3
862	more generations will pass in a short period of time	3
863	more generations= faster evolution	3
864	More generations=More variety.	3
865	More offspring a year.	3
866	More offsprings are being produced.	3
867	More reproductions are occurring.	3
868	More they reproduce more they will get used to their environment to get used to things.	3
869	More traits are passed down instead of some offspring getting a trait and other with a different one	3
870	more variation occers amoung many generations	3
871	more variation of fruit flies could mean more evolution.	3
872	My answer is because they reproduce faster, they will evolve as a species.	3
873	Of course fruit flies because there are way more fruit flies because they reproduce more eggs than elephants and reproduce way more often	3
874	one fruit fly can prouduce more eggs than a elephant can prouduce elephants	3
875	One generation for a fruit fly goes super quick while an elephants generation take hundreds of years	3
876	Organisms can change in a few generations and since the fruit flies reproduce a lot then they have a higher chance of evolving.	3
877	Organisms evolve every 1000 generations, therefore fruit flies will only take a very, very short time to evolve because they produce so fast.	3
878	Organisms evolve over thousands of generations, not years. So if there are more generations per year for the fruit flies, they will evolve faster.	3
879	Over every generation a very slight variation occurs. So, if fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year more variation will happen then if you reproduce once every 5 years.	3
880	over generations, organisms change, to adapt to thier enviroment, and the fruit flies reproduce mmore, so that each generation changes little by litte.	3
881	Reproducing is how things evolve therefor if they reproduce more they evolve faster.	3
882	since a fruit fly reproduces more it must be quicker to evolve then the elephant it multiplies almost seven times as fast.	3
883	since evolution happens from generation to generation and fruit flies reproduce more, I think they will evolve faster.	3
884	Since evolution happens in generations and not over time the fly would evolve faster. It is a genetic prosses and since flies reproduce much quicker they would evolve faster.	3
885	Since evolution happens over many generations the faster the generations go by the faster evolution occurs.	3
886	Since evolution takes place in about one thousand generations and the fruit fly reproduces more often then the elephant making it have more generations, then the fruit fly could evolve faster.	3
887	Since flies live shorter, they have offspring faster, which means the species evolves faster because a million years for us may be a few dozen years for them.	3
888	Since fruit flies birth quicker, the flies' genes may evolve more and more with each generation.	3
889	Since Fruit Flies get reborn more often or faster they would change faster.	3
890	Since fruit flies reproduce faster its more likely for them to evolve faster	3
891	Since fruit flies reproduce faster, they will most likely evolve faster. It takes thousands of generations for evolution to happen, so the fruit flies will likely evolve faster.	3
892	Since fruit flies reproduce more frequently, their offspring are more likely to inherit different types of traits faster.	3
893	Since fruit flies reproduce more often they go through more generations which means they can evolve faster because they reproduce more and have generations go by quicker. On the other hand elephants that reproduce less often, have more time between generations. Since evolution is based on how many generations a species go through it takes longer for the elephant to evolve then the fruit fly.	3
894	Since fruit flies reproduce more often, each new fruit fly will gain a slightly better and new adaptation allowing them to eventually evolve.	3
895	Since fruit flies reproduce the most, there are more chances to evolve and different environments	3
896	Since fruit fly's reproduce faster and more often, they have a better chance at evolving faster.	3
897	Since it takes thousands of generations for a species to evolve, if there are more generations in a shorter amount of time, the species will evolve faster.	3
898	Since more are getting reproduced there will be more offsprings changing the fruit flies.	3
899	Since more fruit flies are produced per year, they have many generations to evolve.	3
900	Since the fruit flies reproduce faster each life of the fruit fly has a possibility to change a little while elephants have to wait once every five years.	3
901	Since there are more generations with the fruit flies because they reproduce more there would be more evolution.	3
902	Since they are reborn more often, they have more chances to change into a different animal.	3
903	since they reproduce 36 times per year they probably evolve 180 times faster	3
904	since they reproduce faster every one that is born comes out a little different.	3
905	Since they reproduce faster maybe some of the offspring will change in way when that baby has offspring they change from the orginal fruitfly into something different	3
906	Since they reproduce faster they will have more generations to evolve.	3
907	The ave more chances to evolve due to breeding amount.	3
908	The average time for evolution is 1000 years. If a fruit fly reproduces that much, it would take only a couple of years for that species to evolve. Elephants, however, would take around thousands of years to evolve.	3
909	The birthrate is faster than the deathrate for fruit flies.	3
910	The extra generations the fruit fly gets gives move chances to change faster.	3
911	The faster a species reproduce the faster it is for the species to evolve, and fruit flies reproduce faster than elephants do.	3
912	The faster a species reproduces, the faster it can evolve because it takes thousands of generations for evolution to occur.	3
913	The faster a species reproduces, the shorter it takes to evolve. It would take about 1,000 generations for a species with 1/year reproduction rate to evolve. if you divide that by 36, which is 27.77, you will see that it only takes about 27.77 years for a fruit fly to evolve. Elephants though, would take 5 times longer to evolve because they reproduce only once every 5 years, so it would take them 5000 years to evolve.	3
914	the faster generations pass, the more evolution occurs.	3
915	The faster the rate of reproduction, the faster a species will evolve. The fruit flies reproduce faster, so they will evolve faster.	3
916	The faster the species reproduces the faster it will hit 1000 generations which is the time you would be able to see a deference because of evolution.	3
917	The faster they reproduce the faster they will know which traits are needed to survive.	3
918	the fru3it flies reproduce more, therefore more chances for mutation, faster.	3
919	The fruit flies are faster because they produce faster.	3
920	The fruit flies are having more generations so their would be more chances to evolve from parent to child.	3
921	The fruit flies can pass down their traits more frequently, which would mean a trait would develop before the elephants.	3
922	The fruit flies could keep reproducing and evolving a lot faster because they can reproduce about three times a month.	3
923	The fruit flies evelove faster because there are nore generations being produced every year an more generations.	3
924	The fruit flies have 36 generations in one year while elephants have one generation in five years. The more generations, the more you evolve.	3
925	The fruit flies have many more generations than the elephant.	3
926	The fruit flies have many more generations to evolve so the fruit flies will evolve much faster.	3
927	the fruit flies must learn to reproduce quickly with so many more numbers,not to mention predaters, and there is an increased chance of deformaties amoung them that change their speies	3
928	The fruit flies produce more letting traits evolve faster.	3
929	The fruit flies reproduce 36 times every year instead of once every 5 years.	3
930	The fruit flies reproduce a lot more. In a year fruit flies produce 36 times a year and elephants reproduce about once every five years.	3
931	The fruit flies reproduce more at a time.	3
932	The fruit flies reproduce over a shorter amount of time than elephants so they will be able to go through generations quicker and also go through naturals selection quicker.	3
933	The fruit flies will evolve and grow faster because of more reproduction.	3
934	The fruit flies will evolve faster because of the more times they reproduce but they would die faster because insects don't have a very long life span.	3
935	The fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce faster so it will have more time to change	3
936	The fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce a lot more than the elephants. Since fruit flies reproduce more, they can evolve a lot faster then elephants.	3
937	The fruit flies will evolve faster because when an animal begins to evolve it takes many life cycles for the process to be complete.	3
938	The fruit flies will have more generations and will adapt faster.	3
939	The fruit flies will have more offspring with different adaptions so they can be helped in their environment. Since there are more fruit fly offspring than elephants, this will allow for the fruit fly to more rapidly evolve.	3
940	The fruit flies will keep on evolving with new abilities. They also reproduce more often so they can keep changing.	3
941	The fruit flies will reproduce faster and be more likely to evolve before the elephants do.	3
942	The fruit flies will reproduce faster because the more you reproduce, the more generations their will be. Also, the more generations there are the better chance they have of evolving.	3
943	the fruit flies would evolve faster because the breed a lot faster than the elephants.	3
944	The fruit flies would have more generations for the evolution of fruit flies, as in each generation it starts to change and change until it changes not fully but changes a lot.	3
945	The fruit flies' generation is quicker so they get to one thousand quicker.	3
946	The fruit fly may have two babies but it reproduced much faster than an elephant.	3
947	The fruit fly population would evolve faster because it reproduces faster than the elephant population.	3
948	The fruit fly reproduces 36 times a year which is way faster than once every 5 years.	3
949	The fruit fly will evolve faster because if they produce more often then their will be more generations and evolution happens within 1000 generations.	3
950	The fruit fly will evolve faster because their is more generation.	3
951	The fruit fly will evolve faster because they have a higher reproductive rate so that adaptations will pass on faster.	3
952	The fruit fly will have more generations per year	3
953	the generations come faster so they would evolve faster	3
954	The generations will be shorter and occur more often, so it will evolve faster.	3
955	The more a specie reproduce the faster they will evolve.	3
956	The more a species reproduce the faster each generation takes to form, making evolution faster.	3
957	the more a spices reproduces the faster it evolves because the changes happen every generation	3
958	The more an organism reproduces the faster that organism will evolve	3
959	The more chances you have to reproduce, the more chances those babies will evolve where they live and then their babies will do, and so on.	3
960	The more generations a species creates, the more chances for that species to have small things change over time.	3
961	The more generations of an species you have, the faster time it takes to evolve.	3
962	The more generations the faster something will evovle. It takes many generations and in two year the fruit flies will have 72 generation while the elephants will only have 10 genrations.	3
963	The more offspring you have the more evolution happens.	3
964	the more organisms the higher chance of evolution	3
965	The more production the faster the evolution	3
966	the more reproduction means more variation and a higher chance of evolving to occur.	3
967	The more reproduction the faster the traits can be born.	3
968	The more the animals reproduce the faster they evolve so the fruit fly has more chances of evolving since it reproduces so much.	3
969	the more they reproduse and have more babies while the world is changing, they might change into something else	3
970	the more times you have kids the more generations are formed so in 5 years elefants have one generation but in 5 years fruit flies have 180 genertations.	3
971	The more you reproduce the faster you are to evolve and changes will happen quicker.	3
972	the more(faster) generations and offspring they make, the faster they will evolve.	3
973	The population is much bigger.	3
974	the produce lots more offspring a lot faster than the elephants could	3
975	The rate of reproduction widely affects the speed of evolution. It takes approximately 1000 years for a species to evolve, if elephants reproduce once every 5 years then it will take 5000 years to evolve. While on the other hand a fruit fly will only take approximately 28 years.	3
976	The reason is that since they are small and reproduce faster and their are so many variations it is easier to reproduce.	3
977	The reproduce faster.	3
978	the reproduce more often	3
979	The reproduce more often than elephants	3
980	the reproducetion rate is much faster than the elephants and evolution happens every thousand generation its most likely to evolve in lesser years than the elephant	3
981	The reproducing rate is mostly where you might see differences in the evolution of the organism. since the fruit fly reproduces faster the evolution may be quicker.	3
982	The3 fruit flies reproduce many more times a year because the process is much quicker.	3
983	Their generations go faster so traits can evolve faster.	3
984	There are more chance of flies because there are more flies.	3
985	"There are more chances to adapt and pass on genetic ""advice"" with fruit flies than elephants"	3
986	There are more generations in fruit flies than elephants, so they will go faster.	3
987	There is a greater chance of change in Fruit flies because of how many are produced.	3
988	There will be so many fruit flies in such a short time.	3
989	there would be more genorations and it takes about a thousand genorations for a animal (or bug) to evolve	3
990	theres more of them	3
991	They are more fruitflies than elephants	3
992	They are more likely to produce an offspring with a mutation. They also have more genetic variation, and are more likely to survive when change comes.	3
993	They breed faster and could have evolved offspring.	3
994	They breed faster so they change faster	3
995	they can produce more and quicker	3
996	they die faster	3
997	they dont live as long and have more generations faster	3
998	They evolve faster because there are more.	3
999	They evolve so much that I think that they will have more time to evolve than the elephant.	3
1000	They evolve the same rate each reproduction, except since fruit flies reproduce faster, so the whole species will evolve faster.	3
1001	they get many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many more chances to reproduce and then change just a little each time.	3
1002	They go through generations a lot quicker.	3
1003	They have a faster chance of evolving because they reproduce faster.	3
1004	they have a shorter life and evolved faster	3
1005	they have a shorter life span and so generatons go by faster	3
1006	they have babies more	3
1007	they have children more frequently.	3
1008	They have many more generations to change their genes so they would evolve faster.	3
1009	they have more babies	3
1010	They have more babies so they have a better chance of changing faster.	3
1011	they have more chance to reproduce, so they have a better chance of finding a useful trait.	3
1012	They have more food to obtain and fruit fly's die in two days	3
1013	They have more generations to evolve than the elephant which would take longer to evolve.	3
1014	They have more generations to evolve.	3
1015	They have more generations which will create new traits.	3
1016	They have more life times to evolve.	3
1017	they have more offspring and each one evolves more	3
1018	They have more offspring and it will be faster.	3
1019	They have more offspring so their is a better chance of some of those offspring having a good chance of getting life helping traits.	3
1020	They have more offspring, so they will change faster.	3
1021	they have more offsprings and they can differ more and change faster	3
1022	They live a shorter life span and reproduce faster letting them have more offspring with more diverse traits.	3
1023	THEY MAKE BABIES FASTER.	3
1024	they make more	3
1025	They pass traits more often.	3
1026	they produce all the time so offspring is a lot faster and the average fruit fly lives up to a week so yes the fruit flies evolve faster then the elephants.	3
1027	They produce faster.	3
1028	they produce more	3
1029	They produce more each year which makes different genes and they will evolve faster.	3
1030	They produce more offspring making more babies.	3
1031	They produce more quickly so there is a more likly chance that something could change and cause a evolution with fruit flies.	3
1032	they produce more times than the elephant, giving fruit flies a better chance to change.	3
1033	They produce more.	3
1034	they r3eproduce faster	3
1035	they reduce more	3
1036	they repoduce much, much more than elephants	3
1037	they reproduce a lot faster and it takes a species 1000 generations to evolve so they would then evolve a lot faster	3
1038	They reproduce faster making, giving them more generations and more variation.	3
1039	They reproduce faster so there are more offspring to evolve.	3
1040	They reproduce faster which means there is more likely a chance of change in the offspring.	3
1041	they reproduce faster, so they evolve faster. this is because they will encounter predators that will be hard to escape.	3
1042	They reproduce faster.	3
1043	they reproduce many times.	3
1044	they reproduce more	3
1045	they reproduce more	3
1046	They reproduce more every year so they would have more generations to evolve.	3
1047	They reproduce more often so they take less time to evolve.	3
1048	They reproduce more so there is more chance of variation.	3
1049	they reproduce more, therefore giving them more of giving them more opportunitys to reproduce	3
1050	They reproduce more, which means they can get different characteristics faster, and evolve quicker.	3
1051	They reproduce more.	3
1052	They reproduce so quickly, so they learn new adaptations quickly.	3
1053	they reproduce way faster than elephants reproduce	3
1054	they will be so many fruit flies in such a short time.	3
1055	They will be so many fruit flies in such short time.	3
1056	They will change a little every time the reproduce.	3
1057	they will evolve faster because they produce a lot faster so there offspring has a lot of time to evolve before the elephants evolve	3
1058	They will go through more generations faster than elephants.	3
1059	They will have more babies and more chance for evolution to take place.	3
1060	They wold change faster because they have more offspring in a shorter amount of time.	3
1061	This is because they are being produced a lot faster.	3
1062	Well if the fruit flies have more generation than the elephant then the fruit flies have times to add in new useful traits.	3
1063	well they reproduce faster and have more babys then the elephant	3
1064	when more and more fruit flies are born they evolve faster because they send off their traits into thier offspring.	3
1065	With a faster rate of birth there is more variation in population, allowing natrual selection to take place.	3
1066	With more generations the slight changes can occur faster.	3
1067	A creature changes a tiny bit in each generation, so the more generations, the more change. If fruit flies are always dying and reproducing, the unhealthy ones are likey to die much sooner.	4
1068	A species needs to evolve over many generations, not just a few, and the fire flies produce offspring faster, so they can evolve more quickly because it takes less time to produce offspring that will inherit their traits.	4
1069	beacuse fruit flies reproduce faster so that the offspring inheiret the traits faster and pass them down faster.	4
1070	Becaus emore generations equal more variation eventually leading to evolution	4
1071	Because fruit flies have a larger amount of offspring there could be more variations in the children and thus a faster and bigger change for evolution to take place. But I think evolution is already taking place in organisms like the fruit flies so there is just a faster way for fruit flies to evolve.	4
1072	Because if you create a new generation 36 times a year, than there is a better chance that there will be more variation.	4
1073	Because since fruit flies populate faster and live faster, there is more of a chance that they would evolve faster based on the amount of variety there is in all the offspring.	4
1074	because the more generations the more time the organism has to evolve because organisms can't evolve in one generation so the more generations the fruit fly can develop more traits.	4
1075	because they are born faster so their is more adaptations over time	4
1076	because they have more babies for a more variation, it is rare to have variation but it is more common if there is more oppurtunity to have it.	4
1077	Due to the fact that flies reproduce so quickly a mutation may occur that is passe on and a evolutionar trait can be passed on faster thus any flies that dont have the power will be taken out although chances are that the ones with the trait will die quickly and the trait will disapear.	4
1078	each time a fruit fly reproduces, different genetic copies will be made, and more and more different genetic copies will be transferred. This way the fruit flies with the best traits will be able to reproduce the most and pass on their genetic genes.	4
1079	Evolution happens over many generations, not a lifetime. The more a species reproduces, the more variation there will be and the more chances it will have to adapt to possible changes in their environment.	4
1080	Evolution happens when you reproduce so if you reproduce 36 times a years more genes will get passed on and they will have different traits but still evolve from the same thing.	4
1081	Evolution occurs over the generations, and if there are more generations in a year, then the adaption happens more quickly.	4
1082	Evolution occurs through reproduction (the two parents pass down their traits to their offspring), and the more an organism reproduces, the quicker the species can evolve, because the genes need to get mixed up enough times for evolution to occur. Since fruit flies reproduce more often than elephants, the fruit flies will definitely evolve quicker than the elephants.	4
1083	Evolution takes many generations, so the more offspring to be born the faster they inherit their parents traits and evolve.	4
1084	"Evolution takes many generations. However, a fruit fly's generation is much much shorter than an elephant's generation. If a trait takes 1000 generations to evolve for both fruit flies and elephants, fruit flies will ""finish"" evolving first because their generations are much shorter."	4
1085	Fruit flies are able to pass genes onto their offspring faster, thus creating a larger population with a new trait sooner.	4
1086	fruit flies are being born and dieing faster than the elephant.	4
1087	Fruit flies because traits that are given to offspring can be passed down faster due to the amount of generations there are.	4
1088	Fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce faster and more often so there is a faster rate for evolution and new species to evolve.	4
1089	Fruit flies have more chance to have variation therefore enabling a higher chance to change if the variation makes that fly's life easier to live in the environment.	4
1090	Fruit flies have more chances to gain new traits, so they evolve faster.	4
1091	Fruit flies have more generations than elephants in a year. Changes happen over generations when offspring inherit traits that are useful on their lives. Of there are more generations in a year, they evolve faster. Hence, fruit flies evolve faster than elephants.	4
1092	Fruit flies have more oppurtunities with their many offsping to vary and evolve.	4
1093	Fruit flies produce faster so their developed traits will be passed on faster than the traits of elephants to their offspring.	4
1094	Fruit flies produce more organisms which become more different than older generations each time so they have a better chance of becoming different faster than an elephant.	4
1095	Fruit flies will be able to evolve faster because they have more offsprings that can have the good traits they want and then all the flies without the good traits will die. The elephant won't produce as many offsprings as the fruit flies so it only have less chances than the fruit flies to get the good traits in an offspring.	4
1096	Fruit flies will evolve faster because 1000 generations will pass first. If they reproduce more, natural selection is sped up. According to nature, if they reproduce faster, natural selection is sped up, meaning fruit flies have shorter life times. Since they reproduce a lot, if they lived longer, there would be too much selective pressure for competition, it would be overcrowded with flies everywhere, and they would all die. We know this by observation. The fruit flies that are weak will die faster, because natural selection will speed up. This is why they evolve faster.	4
1097	Fruit flies will evolve faster because more generations pass by in less time, allowing the flies to adapt more.	4
1098	Fruit Flies will evolve faster because they can produce more offsprings and the offsprings can have the good trait they will help them survive and they will pass it on to their offsprings and so on.	4
1099	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they can take on traits and adapt quicker.	4
1100	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more offspring. They would have more chances of changing because there is more offspring. Elephants, however, have less children, so the changes would happen A LOT more slowly.	4
1101	fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce more and the more they produce the more traits they'll pass down which will cause them to evolve faster	4
1102	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce much more and they might have to adapt to their envronment faster.	4
1103	Fruit Flies will evolve faster, because if offspring is reproducing while their parents till are, the population will grow. The current offspring ill e able to use the acquired and inherited traits that they were given at birth.	4
1104	Fruit flies will probably evolve faster than elephants, because elephants produce less offspring than fruit flies. Fruit flies produce 180 more times than a elephant reproduces. They flies have more offspring so they have more genetic variation, so there is a better chance to evolve.	4
1105	Fruit flies will reproduce and evolve faster because they have more babies and have a more chance of being different.	4
1106	Fruit flies would evolve faster because throughout each generation, variation would occur, developing differences in those fruit flies. Also, if they reproduce 36 times a year and it takes about 1000 generations for a clear difference in evolution, it would take fruit flies about 28 years to completely evolve, while it takes an elephant 5000 years to completely evolve.	4
1107	fruit fly's breed faster and because genes are affected from the environment i think they would be able to evolve if there was a problem because they would change faster to better suit their environment changing.	4
1108	I believe that if the fruit fly reproduces more than there is a better chance of a new trait that could make them evolve	4
1109	I contend that fruit flies will evolve faster because they are producing much more offspring that will have variation and will evolve faster because there are more of them being born in less time.	4
1110	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they produce faster than elephants. their traits will be passed down faster than the traits of an elephant does.	4
1111	I think fruit flies evolve faster than elephants because they have more offspring causing the babies to evolve and adapt.	4
1112	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution occurs when an organism has a difference in its genes, and it gets passed down to its offspring.	4
1113	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because if their are more generations than they can have selective pressure kill the ones with less advantages and the next generations would get more and more advantages.	4
1114	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because the faster it reproduces, the faster it will evolve. The more variety brings quicker evolution.	4
1115	I think Fruit flies will evolve faster because the population is high so they will inherit traits faster.	4
1116	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because there are more offspring to allow for change and adaptions to occur.	4
1117	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because there are much more of them than elephants, and they will get a chance to experience the environment and adapt changes to help them survive.	4
1118	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce way faster than elephants and they can pass on new traits quicker.	4
1119	I think fruit flies will evolve faster than elephants because they reproduce about 36 times a year and elephants only reproduce one every five years so fruit flies will gets their parents traits much faster.	4
1120	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because the flies with unnecessary traits will die faster and the good traits will be passed on many times a year, while elephants will only do that every 5 years. Also, since it takes around a thousand generations to evolve, fruit flies will have a thousand generations in much less time. Natural selection will happen a lot faster with the fruit flies than elephants.	4
1121	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster then elephants because they produce more then an elephant and the fruit flies probably adapt easier then the elephant	4
1122	I think that fruit flies would evolve faster because evolution happens over many generations. The faster it reproduces the faster the generations are made. The more generations, the more traits it will begin to have. Elephants won't evolve faster because of how slow it reproduces and the generations are going slower.	4
1123	I think that fruit flies would evolve faster because it has more variation wich would lead to evolution and it takes about 1000 generations to evolve so it would take the elephant around 5000 years to evolve while it would only take the fruit flies around 27 years	4
1124	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because it takes thousands of generations to evolve, and the more offspring there is, the faster the variation can happen.	4
1125	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more and so they can probably pass down traits more times per generation.	4
1126	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce much more. According to Darwin's Theory of Evolution, it says that overproduction is needed for evolution to occur. This is so that some can die off and others can successfully evolve or create variation in the species. The fruit flies reproduce so much that the fast overproduction will lead to evolution of the fruit flies.	4
1127	I think that the fruit flys would evolve faster because they have offsrping so much that their offsprings may come out different which would cause more evolving species to come and with more and more different species, the entire population would eventually change.	4
1128	If fruit a producing more generations per year , the fruit flies will pass on their traits to the next generation faster than the elephant. The bad ones will die off quicker.	4
1129	If fruit flys reproduce at a much faster rate it will have more chances that that one trait the parent had and no one else had to be past on to the next generation and that baby will mate and have a fly with that trait and one trait that is individual to that. But only the flies with good traits will survive to mate with others. And over time it will evolve so you can notivce it but if you look at elephants they haven't change much from their ancestor the mammoth.	4
1130	If one fruit fly inherits a trait that helps it to survive, then that trait can be passed on to its children, who may inherit that trait. Since fruit flies reproduce so much more than elephants, the good traits will be passed on more quickly.	4
1131	It is because fruit flies die more often and faster so the ones who live will give that trait to the offspring and then sooner or later the whole species will survive longer.	4
1132	It takes many generations for a species to evolve and have certain traits, so the fruit flies can reproduce quickly so they can evolve quickly, whereas the elephants take a long time to reproduce, so they take a long time to evolve.	4
1133	It takes many generations to pass traits to the offspring with a noticeable and helpful difference so the fruit flies would evolve faster.	4
1134	Since fruit flies reproduce faster, there is more variation in the species because of all the things they do in their lifetime. Since evolution takes thousands of generations, and the fruit flies have already gone through many of them because of their reproduction speed, they are more likely to evolve faster than elephants.	4
1135	Since they reproduce more, the more genetic traits will be created over time and they will be passed down to their offspring.	4
1136	So many generations can make evolution faster because the generations can adapt faster to the generation and quickly give it to its offspring.	4
1137	The faster an organism reproduces the faster the species evolves because it will inherit features quicker.	4
1138	The fruit flies evolve quicker because they reproduce much quicker then elephants and produce more offspring due to this they often get adapted to the environment and are able to survive.	4
1139	The fruit flies have more offspring than the elephants so their adaptations it would be more likely to be able to breed true [through].	4
1140	The fruit flies would evolve faster because they are smaller than the elephant and the fruit fly reproduces faster which means a adaptation will come up faster than the elephant.	4
1141	the fruit fly will reproduce faster so more chances a good trait will catch on and change all the fruit flys.	4
1142	The higher the reproduction rate the more chance of variation in population. Since fruit flies reproduce more per year, they are more likely going to have more variation in population than elephants who only reproduce every 5 years.	4
1143	The more generations an organism has in a time span, the faster it can evolve. The more generations it has, new traits can be used and disused, resulting in evolution.	4
1144	The more generations the traits may show more and evolution will take place faster.	4
1145	The more something evolves more their species would have change to occur because if they reproduce quickly they can have more variations in their offspring which will result in evolution occurring earlier for the fruit flies.	4
1146	the more something reproduces the faster the different traits can be past on	4
1147	the more that a population reproduces, the more variation that there will be. variation is important to evolution because there is a better chance of survival of a species if a virus or something kills all the flies with a certain trait, then the others without that trait will live on.	4
1148	The more the generations, the faster traits will change.	4
1149	the more times a speciies reproduces the more the population has a chance of evolving becuase the species has more variation and can pass natural tests and natural selection.	4
1150	The reason I believe fruit flies would evolve faster is because they have offspring more frequently so if they have a good trait then it will be passed down through generations faster.	4
1151	The reason I chose fruit flies is because if a fly that has a good trait produces 36 offspring the trait gets passed on to 36 new flies.	4
1152	The`re would be more of the species to evolve. If the fruit flies were evolving, the new adaptation would come faster through more generations. The elephant has less generations to pass down the new trait.	4
1153	Theirs more baby's which means more variation.	4
1154	There is a more likely chance that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more often. Each generation has variation and the because of that the fruit flies offspring will be different. When their offspring reproduces about 13140 times the elephants will have reproduce once.	4
1155	There is more chance of variation, the more offspring there are and the more chance of variation means more chance of evolving.	4
1156	there would be variation in every single generation and they all go through natural selection that selects out individuals that suit the environment. There would be 1800 generations of fruit flies in 5 years while elephants only have two. So fruit flies could evolve faster than elephants and have a lot more chance of surviving once the environment changes.	4
1157	They give birth to more offspring so they will obtain traits faster than the elephant.	4
1158	They have more offspring causing the babies to adapt and evolve.	4
1159	They reproduce 52.5 times as fast as elephants, letting the species adapt and pass down helpful traits much more quickly.	4
1160	They reproduce a lot so, there is a lot more chances that a mutation comes up. Elephants only reproduce one every five years so, there is a smaller chance that a mutation will come.	4
1161	They reproduce faster so if there's a little change in the environment that has a big effect, they'll catch it and adapt to it so they will reproduce more and match the environment.	4
1162	they reproduce more often and so they can evolve quicker because there would be a variation in the flys, such as some might not be able to fly well or they have small wings and will get eaten, but the ones that have big wings can fly quick and reproduce an evolved species.	4
1163	they reproduce more so they'll have more offspring to adapt with different traits	4
1164	They will have more offspring, giving it a greater chance of a fruit fly adapting and producing more offspring.	4
1165	When a species reproduces more, it give them a faster time for evolution to occur. Very subtle changes happen in every offspring. If fruit flies reproduce more often than elephants, they will have a faster evolution and a better chance to adapt or change.	4
1166	When more offspring are produced more traits will be passed on quicker.	4
1167	when the flys produce offspring, every time they are giing the new traits which enables them to evolve quicker than elephants.	4
1168	With a higher reproduction rate a trait that could help one fly survive could be passed on to hundreds of the other flies over the time of a couple of years.	4
1169	With more generations are being reproduced, the will evolve faster because they will pass down their traits faster.	4
1170	Because fruit flies have many ,many more generations at a time they have a better chance at passing on successful traits, so they will be adapted for their environment sooner.	5
1171	because the more times a speices reproduce the more the variation in the speices.The more variation in the speices the better it adapts to new things.The faster it adapts to new things the faster it evolves.	5
1172	Due to the faster breeding time of the fruit fly, I believe that the flies will produce much more variation, as well as the need to adapt, due to whatever reason they need.	5
1173	Evolution occurs when organisms with traits best suited for the environment pass on these adaptations to their children, and eventually (many generations later), the species will be better suited for the environment as a whole. So, the more a species reproduces, the faster it can evolve. This being said, the fruit fly will evolve much faster than the elephant.	5
1174	Evolution occurs when, over at least a thousand generations, organisms with genetic traits more suited to the selective pressures placed on them (such as lack of food) are more likely to survive to reproduce and pass these advantageous traits down to their offspring, so the faster generations happen, the faster evolution happens.	5
1175	Fruit flies reproduce more times so genetic traits can be passed down quicker. Also,if there is a sudden change in the environment, the fruit flies can evolve quicker and adapt to the environment faster.	5
1176	Fruit flies reproduce more times so genetic traits can be passed down quicker. Also,if there is a sudden change in the environment, the fruit flies can evolve quicker and adapt to the environment faster.	5
1177	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more chances to be a variant with different traits. Also they will have more chances to adapt to the environment.	5
1178	The fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution is based off of natural selection which happens in every generation. With every generation, some organisms (the organisms withe the less beneficial genetic traits) will die off and some organisms (the ones with the more beneficial starting genetic traits) will survive and be able to reproduce. Evolution is generally very slow and will take many generations. The more generations you can cram into a given time, the more natural selection happens and thus the faster evolution happens.	5
1179	the more babies are made, the more that there is a chance of evolution is for the species. more babies will mean more variation, and variation is good, since if one variation is better for the species' survival, and it passes it down to its offspring, then they could acquire the adaptation and spread it around and such.	52
15	36 times a year is faster than once every five times a year.	2
16	36 times a year thats much more than once 5 years.	2
17	According to theory, the elephants will evolve faster, because they will die first, and give theirselves a chance to evolve.	2
18	an elephant can gather alot more traits in 5 years.	2
19	beause there smaller	2
20	becau2se fruit flies die a lot and not that meany elephants die	2
21	because 36 is more than five years it takes longer	2
22	because 36 more than 5.	2
23	because different things can evolve with the fruit fly	2
24	Because elephants are heavier and cant move so much and can't bend down but fruit flies can just sit on fruits and eat	2
25	Because Elephants have been around for so long I don't think that they will be evolvinvg any time soon.	2
26	Because elephants only have kids every 5 years and the Fruit Fly lives for 24 hours and reproduces in that time.	2
27	because elephants take longer and evolution has longer time to evolve but on the other hand fruit flies reproduce very quickly and would not be able to reproduce.	2
28	Because evolution occurs over the generations, so if a fruit fly has small wings but it needs to be able to fly faster, then it's offspring might have larger wings.	2
29	because fruit flies 36 times and theres only 1 elephant every 5 years	2
30	because fruit flies are thaking all the pallen	2
31	because fruit flies are skinnyer and faster while elepants are slower	2
32	because fruit flies are smaller and easier	2
33	because fruit flies are smaller and easyer to evolve	2
34	because fruit flies have a higher chance of dieng when they are born cause predators can eat the as a elephants parents protect it.	2
35	Because fruit flies live for a day and elephants can live for years and years.	2
36	Because fruit flies live for a day and elephants can live for years.	2
37	Because fruit flies live for about one day and elephants can live for many years.	2
38	Because fruit flies only reproduce 36 time a year while elephants only reproduce only one every five years.	2
39	Because fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year	2
40	because fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year while elephant reproduce once every year so i think fruit flies evolve a lot faster cause they reproduce 36 times a year.	2
41	because if there more of the population it can evolve faster	2
42	because if they reproduce 36 times a year they would evolve faster.	2
43	Because it reproduce 36 times a year which is more than once every 5 years.	2
44	because it takes a longer process which would give it more time to evolve.	2
45	because it will have more time me to change	2
46	Because it will share their traits into their offspring.	2
47	Because of how septet it is	2
48	Because of the amount breeding of the fruit fly, they have more chances of evolving.	2
49	Because since the fruit flies reproduce more, they have more chances to gain new traits from their surroundings.	2
50	Because slight evolution occurs in every generation of a species.	2
51	because the elelphant is bigger	2
52	Because the elephant are bigger than the fruit flies.	2
53	because the elephants get bigger every 5 years	2
54	because the flies are smaller and have a greater chance of finding a mate and reproduceing.	2
55	Because the fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year over 5 times a year (elephants)	2
56	because the fruit flies would reproduce every 36 times a year and the elephant would only reproduce every 5 years and the less elephants the less there are to evolve faster.	2
57	BECAUSE THE FRUIT FLIS ARE INSECTS BUT ELEPHANTS ARENT INSECTS BECAUSE THEIR HUGE SIEZE.	2
58	because the fruit fly reproduces 36 times a year and the elaphant only once every 5 years so i think the fruit fly will evolve faster.	2
59	because the have more a better chance of a evolving	2
60	because the more they make the more there is	2
61	Because the only reproduce every 5 years	2
62	because the organism is smaller and takes less time to change.	2
63	because the reproduce about 36 times a year	2
64	Because their are less baby .	2
65	because their little and evolve fatser	2
66	because there are more of them	2
67	because there bigger flies only live for a day	2
68	because there smaller and will become big	2
69	because they are bigger and they dont die as fast as friut flies so they will proble live longer	2
70	because they are small	2
71	because they are small so it takes less longer to evolve.	2
72	because they are small.	2
73	because they are smaller	2
74	because they are smaller and evolve faster	2
75	because they are smaller and over time will get bigger.	2
76	BEcause they are smaller and their DNA is more compatible to evolutions.	2
77	because they are smaller than elephants	2
78	because they are smaller.	2
79	Because they carry diereses	2
80	because they evolve faster then the elephants the elephants reproduce once every 5 years and the fruit flys 36 times a year	2
81	because they get older faster and they will die.	2
82	because they had more time to evolve in there longer life	2
83	because they have faster lifes	2
84	because they have more time than the fruit flies	2
85	because they have more time to notice what could be wrong with them and then they might evolve what seems faster.	2
86	Because they have time to adapt to their surroundings.	2
87	Because they populate less.	2
88	because they produce faster than elephants.	2
89	because they produce less offspringaEU(tm)s.	2
90	Because they reproduce 36 times a year while the elephant only reproduces once every five year.	2
91	because they same time for evoloution	2
92	Because they will have more time to evolve and change before reproducing.	2
93	because they will know what they need and their young will adapt.	2
94	Because, the fruit flies are more smaller and lighter that the elephants.	2
95	becouse they are big	2
96	cause here smaller and they have smaller parrts to evoulte from	2
97	elaphants are fat	2
98	Elefants reproduce less giving them more time to adapt to their environment and evolve better.	2
99	Elephants already have many traits and it evolves once every 5 years. But the fruit fly evolves 36 times a year and is much smaller so it hasn't fully evolved yet.	2
100	Elephants because since they dont reproduce as fast they could adapt to changes unlike the flies reproducing so much theres not enough time to adapt.	2
101	Elephants because their traits will be passed down faster.	2
102	Elephants because there are less of them so they need to learn to survive	2
103	Elephants because they don't reproduce more than the Fruit flies and there are less chances to have more than the fruit flies.	2
104	Elephants because they have a way longer lifespan than fruit flies. Which means there is more time to have an evolutionary trait.	2
105	Elephants because they live longer witch a fruit fly dies like in two days	2
106	elephants because they reproduce every 5 years and probaly more by birthrate.	2
107	Elephants because they will have more time to evolve and gain different traits.	2
108	Elephants because, since their population is so small they could easily grab all the resources they need to survive such as water, food, space, and a environment making it easy to evolve a lot faster.	2
109	Elephants breed slower, so their population is less, and the good traits will be bred in more often than fruit flies.	2
110	Elephants have more human like attributes than fruit flies so they might evolve into humans faster.	2
111	Elephants have more time to adapt to their surroundings and evolve even though they reproduce less than fruit flies.	2
112	Elephants have older siblings and family to help them grow through childhood.	2
113	Elephants have survived longer	2
114	elephants might have more traits that are able to change over time because they carry more traits than flies	2
115	elephants might have more traits that could help it grow/take on more traits that will help it change	2
116	Elephants reproduce less, so they will evolve easily.	2
117	Elephants will evolve faster because it has more time to change and adapt to its envronment.	2
118	Elephants will evolve faster because they will have more time to evolve to their environment if anything happens to the environment.	2
119	Elephants will evolve faster than fruit flies because although there are many more fruit flies than elephants, the elephants will have a longer life and have more of a chance to evolve.	2
120	Elephants will evolve faster than fruit flies because although there are more fruit flies, the elephants will have more time to evolve and change.	2
121	Elephants will have more time to change in their lifetime so that when they finally reproduce the trait will be passed on. Or they will die with a bad trait and it won't be passed on.	2
122	Elephants will involve faster because elephants reproduce about once every 5 years, and the elephants that produce faster will have more kids and pass their traits.	2
123	Elephants, because fruit flies die way more often than elephants.	2
124	Elephants,because they reproduce very slowly, and if one baby's gene is messed up, there won't be really any baby to replace it, so it might evolve to a slightly different specie.But for fruit flies, even if one is messed up, there are a lot of other ones,so the generation will continue on.	2
125	Even if fruit flies reproduce so often, elephants have features that can evolve very easily.	2
126	Even though the elephants take longer to reproduce the fruit flies die everyday, so in the end elephants would win.	2
127	Every time the elephant reproduses the baby will come out diffrent and mabye in the next genarations the reproducing will go faster.	2
128	Fruit Flies, because the more that they reproduce the more that each one will adapt to different places and evolve faster.	2
129	fruit becase they grow 36 times a year and elephants 1 ever 5 years	2
130	Fruit flies are alot smaller then elephants. So evolution is easier to occor.	2
131	fruit flies are flies so it is so possible the flies are faster then an elephant.	2
132	Fruit flies are much faster in flying.	2
133	fruit flies are smaller	2
134	fruit flies are smaller creamers and they are easyer to evolve and change	2
135	fruit flies are smaller so they can evolve and spread faster than elepants	2
136	Fruit flies are smaller so they would have to addapt to thei habbitat	2
137	Fruit flies are smaller than elephants so they require less care and can produce faster because of that.	2
138	Fruit flies are super small.	2
139	Fruit flies are tiny.	2
140	Fruit flies because #6 times in a year is greater than once every 5 years	2
141	fruit flies because the smaller the animal the faster it will evolve and the fly reproduces 36 times a year while the elephant reproduces only 5 times a year.	2
142	fruit flies because there are so many of them they reproduce alot.	2
143	Fruit flies because they are a smaller animal and they move faster than elephants.	2
144	Fruit flies because they are smaller and because they would have to mate a lot to reproduce 36 times a year. To reproduce, they would have to have a partner and that partner could be any kind of insect/ fly. So it would evolve.	2
145	fruit flies because they evolve faste	2
146	Fruit flies because they produce more so then many of them could grow and evolve and look different.	2
147	Fruit flies because they reproduce 36 times a year, and elephants reproduce about once every 5 years.	2
148	Fruit flies because they reproduce so much faster. This gives lots of flies a chance to evolve.	2
149	Fruit flies can multiply two times or more during the elephants five years.	2
150	fruit flies come and leave the community faster than elephants.	2
151	Fruit flies definitely evolve faster because as fruit flies evolve to adapt, the traits learned are passed down to their offspring much faster than elephants.	2
152	Fruit flies dont live very long and you need death in a population for the changes to happen	2
153	Fruit flies evolve much faster, and when both species need to evolve they can do this process through evolution in offspring.	2
154	fruit flies has short life spans, therefore giving them little time to adapt. however, the elephant can live more than 30 years, which gives it plenty of time to evolve	2
155	Fruit flies have 36 chances every year to evolve, while the elephant has only once every five years.	2
156	fruit flies need to evolve to survive because they are small	2
157	Fruit flies reproduce faster, but elephants live longer. That would give them time over each long generation to evolve.	2
158	Fruit flies will evolve faster than elephants because they evolve 36 times a year.	2
159	Fruit Flies will evolve faster, because when more are born, then they have a more likely change to evolve than elephants.	2
160	Fruit flies will reproduce faster because their birth rate is a lot higher than the deat rate, and the elephants reproduce a lot less often.	2
161	Fruit flies will reproduce faster because they are not slow like the elephants are. Fruit flies take a small amount of time to become an adult, unlike the elephant the little baby might take more than a year to be fully grown.	2
162	Fruit flies would evolve faster since they reproduce more giving characteristics they have to more offspring.	2
163	Fruit flies' have a shorter lifetime than a elephant. So the fruit fly would reproduce more.	2
164	Fruit fly's are much smaller and could adapt quicker.	2
165	Fruit flys are smaller and have shorter life spands	2
166	Fruit Flys because if they noticed something bad they have enough generations that would have it so it go down along the line faster.	2
167	Fruitful have more opportunities to evolve than elephants	2
168	fruits flies because when they have a baby a lot more than just one or two will be born.	2
169	has a longer time period to evolve	2
170	i believe that fruit flies will evolve faster because a lot of small animals eat bugs and they don't have a lot of bone dexterity so they are easier to eat and hunt.	2
171	I believe that fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution happens over generations.	2
172	i belive fruit flies evolved faster than elephants because fruit flies are smaller and might not take as much time to evolve as a elephant which has offsprign every five years!	2
173	i choose fruit because they reperdus the fruit	2
174	i choose the elephants because they reproduce every five years and fruit flies reproduce 180 more for every 5 yrs.	2
175	I chose elephants because they reproduce slowly but i think the slower they reproduce the more features they pick up from thy're previous generation.	2
176	I chose fruit flies because if they reproduce 36 times a year, their organisms must affecting them to evolve (maybe even more).	2
177	i chose this because elephants can change more in their longer lifetime and pass it on changing more rapidly and dramatic.	2
178	I feel that the elephant would have a better chance of evolving because the elephants would have a longer amount of life to be able to adapt and evolve to their environment.	2
179	I said fruit flies evolve faster because they are much smaller than an elephant and reproduce 36 times a year and elephants only reproduce 1 every 5 years which is a big difference.	2
180	I said fruit flies, because of how much they produce.	2
181	I think elephants because fruit flies die really fast I think about 2 days is it so they won't really have that chance to have babies and I think elephants because they will need to get faster to water when they travel so I think they will get smaller and faster.	2
182	I think elephants because over time the longer the animal waits to evolve the more it will change while fruit flies evolve 36 times a year and change in tiny incroments elephants save up all the evolutionary trait for 5 years.	2
183	I think elephants because they are bigger and live longer where as fruit flies are smaller and die faster.	2
184	I think elephants because they are larger animals	2
185	I think elephants because they have been around for a while and they are bigger then fruit flies.	2
186	I think elephants because, fruit flies are just really small and stay the same, so I think elephants would have evolved faster.	2
187	I think elephants evolve faster because they are't always reproducing they are evolving faster to.	2
188	I think elephants evolve faster because they reproduce slower.	2
189	I think Elephants will evolve faster because if there is less of them it's easier for them all to change.	2
190	I think elephants will evolve faster because they are easier to find cause they are bigger and Fruit flies are really small insects an its hard to catch them also cause they could fly.	2
191	I think Elephants with evolve faster because they has less babies so more of them can change faster.	2
192	I think elephants would evolve faster because it has more time in between reproduction. If an elephant adapts to its surroundings during a period of 5 years, its offspring will have those adaptations immediately.	2
193	I think fruit flies because elephants only reproduce once every 5 years and fruit flies reproduce 36 every year	2
194	I think fruit flies because they have little to grow and elephants are huge so they have to get all that up there.	2
195	i think fruit flies because they know what to change because it one is not living good they will change to be better	2
196	I think fruit flies because they reproduce 36 times a year while the elephants on reproduces 1 every 5 years	2
197	I think fruit flies because they reproduce faster so they have more chances to evolve.	2
198	I think fruit flies evolve faster because how they are small it might be easier to for them to evolve and they might find new ways to survive faster and get better traits.	2
199	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they are a lot smaller.	2
200	i think fruit flies evolve faster because they have more time to evolve then elephants	2
201	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce about 36 times a year while an elephant reproduces about once every 5 years.	2
202	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce more	2
203	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because each time they reproduce the person will change until a point were the first one will be very different with the last one. They might change to get better traits or to make something better in their life.	2
204	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because if they reproduce 36 times a year,then in that time, they would develop better defenses.	2
205	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it is tiny.	2
206	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it reproduces 36 times a year where elephants reproduce once every five years.	2
207	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because more of them are reproducing faster and the population will increase faster.	2
208	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are smaller and lighter then elephants so it will take less time.	2
209	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are tiny.	2
210	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce pretty fast and the elephant may die after five years so i'm going for the flies.	2
211	I think fruit flies will evolve faster, because there are more of them that need to survive so they need to evolve quickly in order to survive	2
212	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because one fruit fly reproduces about 36 times a year.	2
213	i think fruit flies would evolve faster because they are alot smaller than elephants.	2
214	I think fruit flies would evolve faster, because it says that fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year and elaphants reproduce only 5 time s a year.	2
215	i think fruitflies because they reproduce alot more than elephants	2
216	I think that because each generation will change a bit. The more they reproduce the more change will be made	2
217	I think that Elephants evolve faster because they learn more traits over the years	2
218	I think that elephants evolved faster because there was less population.	2
219	I think that elephants will evolve faster because fruit flies might take up to much energy to evolve faster than an elephant	2
220	I think that elephants will evolve faster because it takes them a while so them the elephants will be able to get different kinds of traits.	2
221	I think that elephants will evolve faster because they don't repeat their genes as much as the flies, so the offspring will have a more longer, different change.	2
222	I think that elephants will evolve faster because, they reproduce slower, which might mean that they'll become extinct faster, which probably means evolution!	2
223	I think that fruit evolve faster because they're body is a lot smaller which means that its not as hard as to evolve.	2
224	I think that fruit flies evolve the faster because they're body is a lot smaller.	2
225	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because as more flies come about they will think of new and better ways for themselves to live. This will result in evolution.	2
226	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more and can experience more.	2
227	I think that it is elephants because they take longer and because they are lager than fruit flies	2
228	I think that the elephant will evolve faster because elephant will never be able to reproduce as fast as other animals and once the elephants have 5 years for 5 babies the dragon flies have 180 fruit flies in five years.	2
229	I think that the elephant will evolve faster because there is more time to change and adapt to the surroundings.	2
230	I think that the elephant will evolve faster, because fruit flies don't really live that long and elephants live longer i think elephants also because they live longer and don't really get killed by humans like flies	2
231	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because it keeps coming and it gets used to everything in its surroundings.	2
232	I think that the fruit fly will evolve faster because the more they reproduce the stronger they can get and they can learn who to breed with to live longer.	2
233	I think that these will evolve faster because if they mate a lot then one of them must mate with a different kind of fruit fly.	2
234	I think that this will happen because the elephants have more time to develop new traits before they have a baby or they would develop more than one trait over time.	2
235	I think the elephant will evolve faster because it's taking it's time to change and fruit flies change 36 times in a year and elephant eat more then fruit flies...	2
236	I think the flies would evolve faster because the flies are smaller and have a lot of predators.	2
237	I think the fruit flies evolved faster because it evolved 36 times a year and the elephant did it once every 5 years.	2
238	I think the Fruit Flies is faster because 36 times a year is every day.	2
239	I think the fruit flies will because they are able to reproduce faster and they might gain more traits this way.	2
240	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because they went through more rough times that they need to survive from.	2
241	I think the fruit flies will, because they have a lot more chances to evolve than the elephants.	2
242	I think they might evolve faster because they are smaller and its quite easier for them to survive.	2
243	i think they will envole by they will grow and get fater and stronger.	2
244	I think this because fruit flies die a lot per day	2
245	I think this because the elephant will have more time to evolve.	2
246	i think this, because it reproduces slower so it has more time to evoulve	2
247	If evolution happens over generations than the faster the generations grow the faster they evolve	2
248	it gives them more time to change	2
249	it hurts	2
250	it must survive long enough for it to adaped to its enviorment and evolve to be able to survive fruit flies average life span is less than a day	2
251	It only takes an a elephant 5 years to reproduce so that pretty fast.	2
252	It take very long for some one or something to evolve.	2
253	More expansion=more different types	2
254	More offspring means their are more generations, so in 5 years an elephant will have one generation, while a fruit fly will have many, making each fly more adapted to its environment.	2
255	more time	2
256	more time to develope traits to offspring	2
257	more traits are passed down through less amount of offspring	2
258	More varieties of fruit flies could be considered.	2
259	over a slower and longer time span a species can gain more attributes and traits.	2
260	"print>>> ""ALL THAT OFFSPRING!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"""	2
261	Say fruit flies reproduce so much, they will have so much of the same thing that say one of they changed in a way that is beneficial, the rest would not be affected by it. Elephants on the other hand, if they have some change that is beneficial, and reproduce, alot of that animal would be changed. Back to the fruit flies, i am pretty sure they are like bees, where they have a queen who does all the reproducing, so if they want to evolve, the change must happen in the queen.	2
262	Since they are so much smaller and faster than elephants i think that is why.	2
263	since they don't reproduce as fast then there a bigger chance they willl envoled faster, because when reproducing slower they can change more easly.	2
264	smaller	2
265	The 2reason I think its elephants is because even though they reproduce only once every 5 years that offsprings generations that they have could change all their genetics.	2
266	The birthrate is faster than the elephants birthrate.	2
267	the changes go down every generation so fruit flies all the way!!!	2
268	the elephant because it has a longer time period to change then the fruit fly	2
269	the Elephant will evolve faster because it has a longer life period	2
270	The elephants because they take longer to reproduce causing it to evolve more knowledge and adapt more information every once a year or so if anything (like their surroundings/habitat) changes.	2
271	The elephants evolve faster because there's genetic diversity while the over-reproduction of fruit flies, they didn't have much diversity so elephants would evolved faster.	2
272	The elephants reproduce slower but they don't have to do it as often.	2
273	The elephants will evolve faster because their parent's will have more time to evolve in between each elephant baby, causing the baby to get traits faster.	2
274	The elephants would evolve faster because their 'bad traits' would leave faster...	2
275	the fruit flies die much faster than elephants.	2
276	The Fruit Flies have more of a chance to evolve than the elephants.	2
277	The fruit flies will be able to go faster.	2
278	The Fruit flies.	2
279	The fruit fly would have evolved faster due to its mating frequently.	2
280	The Furit fly because it will have more time to make changes to its spieces.	2
281	the more generations that pass the faster the animal will evolve.	2
282	The more of a species created the more natural selection is used.	2
283	the more offspring the higher chance of evolving	2
284	the more things die the faster they will evolve	2
285	The process of natural selection has the chance of happening faster.	2
286	The rate of reproduction states it.	2
287	The reason I think its elephants is because they might reproduce once every 5 years but during that time the environment they live in could change in different ways. Therefore that would make them change so they could get used to their new type of environment.	2
288	The reason why i picked Elephants is, because they have more time to change before they reproduce.	2
289	their climate is constantly changing so they need new features to survive.	2
290	there an type of bug and fruit flies can be much faster then the elephant.	2
291	there are more chances for change	2
292	there are more chances for them to	2
293	There are more chances to pass down traits to the next generation.	2
294	There are more fruit flies causing more posibilities of them evolveing to a differnt species.	2
295	there is alot of genitic diversity.	2
296	there smaller and eat faster	2
297	there smaller witch will make them grow bigger cause there small	2
298	there will become way more Fruit Flies over years.	2
299	There would be less elephants that would evolve and therefore all the elephant s might change while only half of the fruit fly's population has evolved	2
300	They are a much smaller species, being easier to evolve	2
301	They are bigger have tough skin and able to protect themselves.	2
302	they are born faster	2
303	They are small so it may not take as much effort.	2
304	They are smaller	2
305	They are smaller and do not have to change a lot because they are small	2
306	They are smaller and more veriatys	2
307	They are smaller and sometimes can change quickly beccause they need adapt to other things trying to cool or eat them	2
308	They became from Mammoths then into elephents	2
309	They become older during the months not the years while the elephants change during the years.	2
310	they die in 24 hours and they have tons of babyaEU(tm)s	2
311	They evolve faster because a fruit fly is smaller an because they don't live for that long and because the can evolve at a much quicker rate.	2
312	They have a biiger chance of evolution.	2
313	they have more chances	2
314	They have more chances to give birth and evolution happens mostly through birth.	2
315	they have more time to adapt to there surroundings	2
316	They have more time to evolve because there reproduce slower.	2
317	They have more times a year to adapt. If say, their wing size needs to be adjusted, they have 36 generations a year to evolve, while the elephants only have one every 5 years.	2
318	they little	2
319	They might evolve faster because if there's a serious drought and no fruit grows, they might evolve to not needing fruit so much to survive.	2
320	they produce 36 times a year and they are also more comen	2
321	they reproduce a lot faster than the elaphants.	2
322	They reproduce fewer then most things on the planet . if humans hunted them down for their hide and their population droped really far down they would most likely evoulve to survive	2
323	They reproduce more.	2
324	They will evolve faster because they are way smaller so it won't have to change that much.	2
325	They will evolve faster when it changes every month.	2
326	They would evolve faster because they have time to adapt to their surroundings. They would have evolved in that time but, the fruit flies could have not.	2
327	they would have a longer time to evolve	2
328	They would have more time to pass on the traits that they learn in their lifetime quicker.	2
329	To evolve you need time.	2
330	to reproduce faster.	2
331	We should never use Birth Control! Obviously the Elephant knows that!	2
332	Well for one thing fruit flies are way smaller than elephants, so that means that the fruit flies babies or eggs are going to be smaller that the elephant's baby. It also might be harder for the mother elephant to have one baby because of its size.	2
333	Well fruit flies reproduce 36 times and the fruit flies are smaller than elephants.	2
334	well if a fruit fly mates and reproduces its more likely there will be a variation between the babies.	2
335	well its common sense. 36 times a year and 1 time every 5 years. So fruit flies.	2
336	Since they reproduce faster, more changes can be made in a shorter amount of time.	3
337	Because fruit flies reproduce about 36 times a year and elephant only reproduces about once every 5 years. A fruit fly also is smaller than a elephant.	3
338	Fruit flies, because they reproduce more often, evolving and expanding their species and variations.	3
339	Species evolve over generations, and if the fruit flies have more generations, the more likely it is for them to evolve faster.	3
340	The Fruit flies can reproduce 5 times faster than the elephant.	3
341	36 is much bigger than 1 every 5 years while 36 each year so fruit flies.	3
342	36 times a year is faster than once every 5 years.	3
343	a fruit fly because it produces more than the elephants per year.	3
344	A fruit fly evolves faster than an elephant because the fruit fly reproduces 36 times a year while elephants reproduce about once a every 5 years.	3
345	A fruit fly would evolve faster because it reproduces more, so its generations can help the species change, it takes a long time for there to be new generations for elephants, so therefore, fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
346	a species can make a noticeable change every couple thousand generations,if flies have more generations per year then they have more generations and therefore change faster	3
347	A species evolves about every 1000 generations since fruit flies reproduce more often than elephants that 1000 generations will come sooner	3
348	a species that spawns faster evolves faster, variation is more likely to occer over many generations	3
349	As fru3it flies live a short life they can mate many times in a year giving lots of generations to change.	3
350	As fruit flies reproduce faster, there might not be enough food to help them survive and give them energy.	3
351	becaause each has to enheiret the traits that are evolving	3
352	BEcasue since there are more of them only the fittest ones will survive. So since there are more of them they have a better chance of having good unique qualities.	3
353	becasue there are more of them	3
354	becasue with fruit flies they reproduce way more so that means that more generations will come and go, and with more generations that means that they will be able to change/evolve faster unlike the elephant.	3
355	Because they reproduce 36 times which means more fruit flies and they will evolve faster	3
356	Because at the rate the fruit flies are reproducing it is obvious that the fruit flies will be the one that repopulate faster.	3
357	because elephants are more unike	3
358	because every year we get 36 fruit flies and the more the fruit flies population grows. the elephant only reproduces once evry five years so there might be less elephants	3
359	Because evolution happens every time an organism gives birth, so for the fruit flies, evolution occurs much faster than most other animals.	3
360	Because evolution occurs over many generations and if the fruit fly reproduces way more than the elephant then it will evolve much faster too.	3
361	Because evolution takes a certain amount of generations, and fruit flies would have more generations in less time.	3
362	because flies only live for 34 hours so they have to make offspring very fast.	3
363	because fruit flies have babies faster	3
364	Because fruit flies have many generations	3
365	because fruit flies have more offspring I think they evolve faster than the elephants who have to produce about every five years.	3
366	Because fruit flies is smaller so it takes less time to evolve.	3
367	because fruit flies life span is like a week so that means they will evolve more fater.	3
368	because fruit flies produce 36 times every year while elephants don't even reproduce one time in a year.	3
369	because fruit flies produce offspring more so they might change faster then elephants	3
370	Because fruit flies reproduce 36 times and elephants once every 5 years.	3
371	Because fruit flies reproduce about 36 times a year while elephants reproduce about once every 5 years.	3
372	Because fruit flies reproduce faster than elephants, they will evolve faster than elephants.	3
373	Because fruit flies reproduce faster, they would evolve faster because they would have more generations in a shorter amount of time.	3
374	Because fruit flies reproduce more often, more offspring will be given the successful trait every year.	3
375	Because fruit flies reproduce more, the species will evolve faster.	3
376	because fruit flies reproduce so much faster. evolution means change over time. time key word. generations is what it means over time so the faster the generations reproduce the faster the evolve.	3
377	because fruit flies will have shorter generathions so if the elefent grows wings in 100 generathions it will take longer then fruit flies losing wings in 100 generathions.	3
378	because fruit flys produce more and i read/heard that bears can be pregant for about 1 year or something like that.	3
379	because if fruit flies reproduce faster then they can evolve faster because if a fruit fly changes every time it reproduces (lets just say) then there will be 36 changes in a year but for an elephant there would only be 1 change in every 5 years	3
380	Because if fruit flies reproduce so fast, it gives them a better chance of evolving.	3
381	because if you reouce more you evolve faster	3
382	Because in 2 years there will be 73 fruit flies and only 1 new elephant.	3
383	because it reproduces faster than elephants	3
384	Because it takes many generation to evolve so the more you reproduce the more generations there is going to be.	3
385	Because its a smaller creature and may produce lots more offspring and they might produce faster.	3
386	because more fruit flies are hatched in a day than elephants are born in a year.	3
387	Because more generations pass for the animal to evolve.	3
388	because more produced the more likely one will evolve and for evolution to happen some must die and if there is a lot of them and some will surely die then they are more likely to evolve	3
389	because more traits are passed slowly	3
390	Because of a shorter time span then the elephant, the fruit fly has a need to reproduce quicker and this may cause more variation in the offspring.	3
391	because related families of fruit flies like odonata reproduce a lot. And hemoptera reproduce tons faster than elephants	3
392	Because since they are reproducing more, there are more fruit flies so they can evolve faster.	3
393	Because the elephants have less time to evolve, making the fruit flies much faster reproducing, letting them have more time to evolve.	3
394	because the form ofspring faster and smaller	3
395	because the fruit flies make more babies	3
396	Because the fruit flies produce more than an elephant could in 5 years..	3
397	Because the fruit flies produce more they may have a larger varriation of their kind.	3
398	Because the fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year so they could evolve because they reproduce even more and the more they are the faster they might evolve.	3
399	Because the fruit flies reproduce faster.	3
400	Because the fruit fly reproduces faster, it will change more.	3
401	Because the fruit fly reproduces more the different traits will evolve faster than an elephant.	3
402	Because the generations go by much faster and take less time.	3
403	because the more and more that come the more fruit flies will evolve.	3
404	because the more generations you have the faster they will change and adapt to there surroundings	3
405	because the more ofspring the faster the newer type comes out	3
406	Because the more they reproduce the more they will get used to modern day.	3
407	Because the more you produce the faster you evolve because you can pass your good traits down.	3
408	because the reprodce more a year than an elephant	3
409	Because the speed of the reproduction of fruit flies is much faster so then so would the evolution.	3
410	Because their are many more fruit flies and they produce more each year then they will evolve at a faster rate than the large animal, the elephant.	3
411	Because their bodies are smaller than elephants	3
412	Because their smaller.	3
413	Because there are more babies that can change faster because the Fruit fly reproduces faster.	3
414	because there are more of them	3
415	because there are more of them.	3
416	Because there are so many fewer elephants, the elephants would not take as long to evolve, because of the lack of nonevolved mates.	3
417	because there is more fruit files and not so much elephants	3
418	because there is more of a chance to evolve with fast reproduction.	3
419	because theres more generations as the fruit fly reproduces and that could evolve and change with the environment	3
420	because they are bigger animals and easy to spot and fruit flies fly so they cant be caught in anything or no animals can catch them	3
421	because they are reproducing faster so they will probably evolve faster than the elephants	3
422	Because they are smaller.	3
423	Because they breed more so then they are able to change faster than somthing that is only born every 5 years.	3
424	Because they don't live long, they evolve very fast.	3
425	because they get a lot of off spring	3
426	because they give off more offspring	3
427	because they have a short life time.	3
428	because they have faster generations so there is a shorter time it takes for them to evolve	3
429	because they have more babies so more and more fruit flies will get the good trait	3
430	Because they have more generation to change in a year, and I know and use the math.	3
431	Because they have more generations in a year then elephants.	3
432	Because they have more generations/time to develop new traits.	3
433	because they have more kids that might have different traits than the parents so that they can survive.	3
434	Because they have more of themselves to evolve from.	3
435	because they have more offspring	3
436	because they have more offspring	3
437	because they have more to evolve	3
438	because they make more flies	3
439	because they make more than elephates	3
440	because they make new fruit flies more often	3
441	because they produce a lot more and eventually after a little bit the genes from different fruit flies will evolve into something else.	3
442	because they produce more faster.	3
443	because they produce more in the same amount of time. When an elephant reproduces once the fruit flies will have reproduce seven times.	3
444	Because they produce offspring a lot they would get traits quicker.	3
445	because they reproducd more	3
446	Because they reproduce 36 times a year.	3
447	because they reproduce a lot more	3
448	because they reproduce faster	3
449	because they reproduce faster and for often	3
450	because they reproduce faster than elephants	3
451	because they reproduce faster than elephants.	3
452	Because they reproduce faster they would evolve faster. As it reproduces changes could happen and it would evolve.	3
453	Because they reproduce faster, they can will be able to adapt to there environment.	3
454	Because they reproduce faster.	3
455	because they reproduce faster. that means faster evolution.	3
456	Because they reproduce more often so it allows for more change in thew offspring.	3
457	because they reproduce more often which makes more fruit flies.	3
458	because they reproduce more they will change faster for their enviroment.	3
459	because they reproduce more with more chance of their babies getting the evolutionary advantage faster	3
460	Because they reproduce so many times per year, the fruit flies will have a better opportunity to evolve over time.	3
461	"Because they will have more opportunity to reproduce than the elephants. If a fruit fly ""wants"" to pass on a good trait, it will be able to more often."	3
462	Because they will produces faster and will have more of a ability to live.	3
463	Because to make so many in a lifetime the ahve to evlove quickly. I think this because firit fies can die esaily.	3
464	becuase more offsprings can change faster as a group and survive better.	3
465	becuse they do it 36 times a year and elephants only do it 5 times	3
466	becuz there r more variateion in reproduction in frut fly	3
467	cause repodution rate will help them	3
468	Cause the fruit flies will be able to pass down there genes faster and will change faster.	3
469	cause they have more offsprings that will get the trait	3
470	Each fruit fly would have some offspring which would have more offspring. Many changes through genes could have happened.	3
471	elephants because the elephants reproduce once every 5 years and they could be faster	3
472	Elephants don't make as many baby's that could change the species.	3
473	Elephants evolve faster because they have more time to change.	3
474	Elephants take longer to reproduce than flies, making the fruit flies evolve faster	3
475	Even though the elephant population is less than the fruit fly population, elephants live longer and adapt to changes.	3
476	Even though you don't evolve every time you reproduce if you reproduce faster you have a better chance to evolve before the other that is why i choose fruit flies.	3
477	Every 5 years the fruit fly has reproduced 180 time and the elephants has reproduce 1.	3
478	Every generation of animals would be a little more advanced than the previous generation. Because fruit flies reproduce so many times in one year, they have more chances to become more and more sophisticated. Elephants reproduce much slower, so evolution would happen slower.	3
479	Every generation, the organism changes slightly. So the faster the generations come, the faster the change comes. So that is why fruit flies would evolve faster since their species have 36 generations a year while elephants only have a generation every 5 years.	3
480	Evolution can only occur with thousands of generations, and the evolution depends on how fast a species' rate of reproduction is.In order to have many generations at a faster rate, then the species must reproduce at a faster rate.	3
481	Evolution doesn't take a specific number of years but a specific number of generations. If a species reproduces quicker that means it has more generations in a lower amount of time.	3
482	evolution goes faster when species reproduce faster because traits are selected faster	3
483	evolution happens during generations not years so the longer it takes for species to reproduce the longer it takes evolution to occur.	3
484	evolution happens faster when reproduction happens faster	3
485	Evolution happens over 1000 generations which can be in only a couple of years if reproduction is fast enough, so fruit flies would evolve faster than elephants.	3
486	Evolution happens over generations of life, the fruit fly reproduces quicker, so it evolves quicker	3
487	Evolution happens over generations, so the faster the generations, the faster the fruit flies would change.	3
488	evolution happens over many generations so the flies will reproduce faster and evolve faster	3
489	evolution happens over many years and since the fruit flies reproduce faster their species will evolve faster	3
490	evolution happens over thousands of generations. each generation for a fruit fly happens much more often than elephants.	3
491	Evolution happens over thousands of generations. So if a fruit fly can get in 36 generations in one year, it would only take less than 30 years for a change in the species. If elephants get a generation once every 5 years, it would take 5000 years for a change in the species. So the fruit flies would definitely evolve faster.	3
492	Evolution occurs by generation, and there are about 360 fruit fly generations in 10 years, and only about 2 in 10 years in elephant generations. The species with the faster reproduction rate will reproduce faster, therefore evolving faster.	3
493	Evolution occurs over about 1,000 generations. Because of the fruit flies faster reproduction rate they would get to that marker faster than the elephant.	3
494	Evolution occurs throughout about 1000 generations, so if there are more generations being produced evolution may occur at a faster rate.	3
495	Evolution takes about 1000 generations and if they reproduce that fast it would proverbially take less time	3
496	Evolution takes many generations. Fruit flies have more generations every few years than elephants, so they have more generations to evolve from.	3
497	Evolution takes place in a number of decades, and when you reproduce more, the generations go by faster.	3
498	Evolution takes place over many generations so since the fruit flies reproduce about 36 times a year they would evolve much faster than the elephant which reproduces about once every 5 years.	3
499	Evolutions occur over generations so when generations are shorter it takes less time to evolve.	3
500	Evoluton takes place over many generations. The faster the generations are, the faster the evolution is.	3
501	Faster birth rate means that there are more animals that can evolve.	3
502	faster reproduction	3
503	flies because they have a faster birth rate.	3
504	Flies because they have a shorter life so they can evolve quicker.	3
505	flies die in two days	3
506	Flies reproduce thousands of times faster than elephants, making it so that there are many more generations.	3
507	Fruit files reproduce faster that's why they evolve faster.	3
508	Fruit flies because evolution takes a thousand years so the fruit fly will have more opportunities to change.	3
509	Fruit flies because if they reproduce 36 times a year while the elephant only reproduces only once every 5 years, then the fruit flies will definetly grow faster.	3
510	Fruit flies because more times an animal reproduces the bigger the evolution.	3
511	Fruit flies because since they have more babies they have a better chance to evolve.	3
512	Fruit flies because since they reproduce faster they have a better chance to evolve.	3
513	Fruit flies because the flies reproduce 36 times a year and the elephants reproduce every 5 years so the fruit flies could reproduce faster and evolve faster.	3
514	fruit flies because the fruit flies can make generations faster because they reproduce faster.	3
515	Fruit flies because there would be more of them to chance over the short period of time when elephants aren't able to change as quickly.	3
516	Fruit flies because they can reproduce faster so the can evolve fastetr.	3
517	fruit flies because they could reprodose faster then an elephant	3
518	Fruit Flies because they evolve about 36 times a year unlike elephants.	3
519	Fruit flies because they have a shorter life span and have more offspring that an elephant does.	3
520	Fruit flies because they have more offspring so they have more chances to evolve.	3
521	Fruit flies because they produce flies faster so the chance of it becoming different every time is possible.	3
522	Fruit flies because they reproduce 36 times a year over 1 time every 5 years.	3
523	Fruit flies because they reproduce every year and plus it reproduces 36 times while the elephant produces one every five years	3
524	Fruit flies because they reproduce faster	3
525	Fruit flies because they reproduce faster and will gain and pass traits down faster.	3
526	fruit flies because they reproduce faster so they will evolve faster.	3
527	fruit flies because they reproduce faster than elephants	3
528	Fruit flies because they reproduce faster.	3
529	Fruit flies because they reproduce more which means more chance of variation. Animals can't evolve without variation.	3
530	Fruit flies because they reproduce very fast and there might be more of them.	3
531	Fruit flies because when the fruit flies lay their eggs, there is millions of them, So when they hatch there is so many fruit flies from just one mother/the one that produces the eggs.	3
532	Fruit flies breed much faster than Elephants there for there is more times where change can occur.	3
533	fruit flies can evolve faster because they can reproduce more offspring which can evolve	3
534	Fruit Flies can reproduce faster than elephant	3
535	Fruit flies continue to make more a lot faster than elephants there for making improvements on it's body faster.	3
536	Fruit flies could have more off spring in the same time as elephants.	3
537	Fruit Flies develop faster because they develop 36 times a year.	3
538	fruit flies die and reproduce much faster than elephants, so the have more generations to evolve.	3
539	fruit flies die faster so they know to reproduce more because they know they die fast	3
540	Fruit flies evolve 36 times a year and are much smaller so it would need to evolve more. The elephant only reproduces once every 5 years and is already really big.	3
541	Fruit flies evolve a lot faster because they reproduce a lot faster. They grow different features too.	3
542	Fruit flies evolve faster because they don't live to long.	3
543	Fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce faster so there is more generations for them to evolve.	3
544	Fruit flies evolved faster because it reproduces 36 times a year while the elephant does it once in every 5 years.	3
545	Fruit flies have 180 generations in the time it takes an elephant to have a new generation, so more generations means that there is more evolution happening.	3
546	Fruit flies have a better chance of creating offspring with new traits.	3
547	Fruit flies have a better chance of evolving because they have more kids then the Elephant.	3
548	fruit flies have a better change of changing and the evolve faster because the reproduce more often giving each fly they reproduce a chance to change.	3
549	Fruit flies have a faster reproduction rate than elephants and it takes less time for fruit flies to reproduce, therefore fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
550	fruit flies have a short life span allowing generations to go faster.	3
551	Fruit flies have a shorter life span than elephants.	3
552	Fruit flies have alot of babies, but most of them don't survive for that long. With elephants they have less babies both mostly all of the time they survive	3
553	Fruit flies have had more generations to change.	3
554	Fruit flies have many generations in a shorter amount of time, this increases the amount that it can evolve in one year.	3
555	Fruit flies have more babies so they change more quickly.	3
556	Fruit flies have more generations in a shorter amount of time, so they would continue the process of evolution far faster.	3
557	Fruit flies have more offspring, so more of them will die allowing the population to grow much faster.	3
558	fruit flies have more offspring, therefor more generations to faster evolve	3
559	fruit flies have offspring more often meaning more chances to evolve.	3
560	Fruit flies have offspring more often, so good traits are passed on more often.	3
561	fruit flies have short life spans so for them to grow into adults before they die they have to mature very fast. Also female fruit flies can lat many eggs at once while female elephants can only give birth to one offspring.	3
562	Fruit Flies lay a lot more babies faster than elephants a fruit flie makes babies everyday a elephant does it in years.	3
563	Fruit flies lay eggs and they may lay many eggs and if they lay eggs 36 time a year plus there is probably a lot of fruit flies to lay eggs unlike elephants they are mammals which means they don't lay eggs so it means that each female elephant in the world have 1 baby elephant after the next 5 yrs they will be another.	3
564	Fruit flies life spand is much shorter than elephants so they go through genorations fater to and so traits will be passed on faster than the elephants.	3
565	Fruit flies may evolve faster because it reproduces lots of times in a year and the elephant just once, so the flies have a faster rank of evolution.	3
566	fruit flies might evolve faster because fruit flies reproduce faster than a elephant and chanages can occur in every baby.	3
567	Fruit flies might have evolved faster because they would have more generations, every year so their evolution rate would be faster. If they only reproduced every 5 years, the time they'd take to evolve would be around 200 years. But fruit flies would be around 1,000 divided by 36, which is about 118 years.	3
568	Fruit flies produce 36 times a year so an offspring could come along with a genetic difference.	3
569	Fruit flies produce generations more quickly than elephants, which means they will evolve faster if a needed.	3
570	Fruit flies produce more generations in a shorter period of time. This means that the species will change much quicker then the elephants, which produce generations slower.	3
571	Fruit flies produce more off-spring which probably reproduce faster and they will move to more environments more often because they are more capable of moving then the elephants so they would evolve once thy got to a different environments.	3
572	Fruit flies produce offspring more than elephants so they would evolve faster over the generations.	3
573	Fruit flies reproduce a lot faster than elephants.	3
574	Fruit Flies reproduce a lot making there more difference whicch helps them evolve faster.	3
575	Fruit flies reproduce about 36 times a year while elephants reproduce about once every 5 years therefor the fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
576	Fruit flies reproduce faster making evolution work faster.	3
577	Fruit flies reproduce faster so natural selection will occur faster and therefore will evolve faster.	3
578	Fruit flies reproduce faster then elephants because they have a faster traits than elephant.	3
579	Fruit flies reproduce faster which means it can evolve faster.	3
580	Fruit flies reproduce faster, die quicker, and are ultimately smaller than elephants.	3
581	Fruit flies reproduce faster, so the amount of time/generations it takes to evolve/adapt will be faster than the generations/time it takes for elephants to evolve.	3
582	Fruit flies reproduce more because they are small... and they can easily be born and... therefore leaving the point that they can reproduce.	3
583	FRUIT FLIES REPRODUCE MORE OFTEN THAN ELEPHANTS SO THEIR BABIES WILL HAVE MORE OF A CHANCE TO EVOLVE	3
584	Fruit Flies reproduce more than the elephant so the fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
585	fruit flies reproduce more than the elephant.	3
586	Fruit flies reproduce more that elephants do so fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
587	Fruit flies reproduce more, so they change faster.	3
588	Fruit flies reproduce much faster and has many generations. Over those generations, which could just be a couple of years, they could have evolved into something different.	3
589	fruit flies reproduce much more often and if a reproduction goes wrong the reproduction would keep going even with one change in a pattern	3
590	Fruit flies reproduce much more often than elephants so the chance one will be born differently is larger than the chance of an elephant being born differently.	3
591	fruit flies reproduce quickly, making the process of evolution faster. elephants don't reproduce as rapidly, meaning it would take longer for them to evolve.	3
592	Fruit flies reproduce so much more they would have more chances to change.	3
593	Fruit flies reproduce very often, while elephants don't. The fruit flies probably experience time more slowly than elephants. Their species probably changes every fifty or sixty years, unlike elephants who probably take a much longer time to evolve.	3
594	Fruit flies reproducer quicker because they reproduce 36 times while the elephant only reproduced once every year so the flies reproduce faster.	3
595	Fruit flies that reproduce faster so fruit flies would be able to pass on the characteristics that they had gained during their lifetime, but elephants can't reproduce as fast.	3
596	fruit flies they are smaller.	3
597	Fruit flies will be able to evolve faster, because they can go through many, many generations in the time it would take an elephant to go through just a few. And because evolution happens over about a thousand generations, fruit flies would take about 3 years to evolve, and elephants would take about about 5000 years to evolve.	3
598	Fruit flies will because the produce more and a faster rate.	3
599	fruit flies will because they have a lot more chances to evolve by having more of them.	3
600	"Fruit flies will change rapidly b/c the ones who don't survive die and cannot reproduce while the others can and then the get children really fast ( this ""refines"" some of the traits they have while ""excluding"" others)."	3
601	Fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution happens over thousands of generations, and because the reproduction rate for the fruit fly is much higher, it will also evolve much faster.	3
602	Fruit flies will evolve faster because if there is more of fruit flies then they have a better chance of evolving faster.	3
603	Fruit flies will evolve faster because more fruit flies are produced in a year than elephants are.	3
604	Fruit flies will evolve faster because more of them are being born more often than elephants.	3
605	Fruit flies will evolve faster because more of them are reproduced in a year than elephants.	3
606	Fruit flies will evolve faster because the faster they reproduce, evolution happens more quickly.	3
607	Fruit flies will evolve faster because the have progeny faster.	3
608	Fruit flies will evolve faster because the reproduce more often than elephants	3
609	Fruit flies will evolve faster because the reproduce more.	3
610	Fruit flies will evolve faster because their can develop their traits faster and become more suited to their environment faster.	3
611	Fruit flies will evolve faster because their rate of reproduction is faster. Evolution takes thousands of generations to occur, and a thousand generations for a fruit fly is a shorter period of time than a thousand generations for an elephant.	3
612	Fruit flies will evolve faster because there is more of them,so they is a greater chance of evolving.	3
613	Fruit flies will evolve faster because there will be more generations to evolve.	3
614	Fruit flies will evolve faster because there will be more of them.	3
615	fruit flies will evolve faster because theres more generations and reproduction which helps evolution	3
616	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they are a lot smaller than the elephant. The smaller the animal the faster it will reproduce. The faster it will reproduce the faster evolution occurs.	3
617	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they can reproduce faster than the elephants.	3
618	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they evolve 180 times for every one elephant. This gives more that can change faster.	3
619	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have a shorter life span and they have offspring at a faster rate and more at one time.	3
620	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more generations to evolve.	3
621	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more of a chance to give birth to an evolved fruit fly.	3
622	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more offspring which could hold a new item or evolution.	3
623	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce a lot more organisms and not all of them will survive.	3
624	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce a lot more and they can use that to their advantage. If they have a trait one generation the next generation might have it a little better and so on.	3
625	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce a lot more often then elephants.	3
626	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster.	3
627	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster.	3
628	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more than elephants and that means more offspring which means there is more of them to evolve.	3
629	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more than elephants. elephants only reproduce every five years but fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year.	3
630	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more.	3
631	fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce much faster and that means that the fruit flies and if there is difference in the flies the most dominant will survive	3
632	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce much more than an elephant.	3
633	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce quicklier, they need 1 thousand of generations t evolve, they would take a shorter period of time to reach thousands of generations. By the other hand, elephants will take much more time to evolve because they take more time reproducing and going from generation to generation.	3
634	fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce so often they will go through 1000 generations MUCH faster than elephants would.	3
635	Fruit Flies will evolve faster than elephants because fruit flies reproduce so much faster than them.	3
636	Fruit flies will evolve faster than the elephants because the fruit flies reproduce much faster than elephants. This means that the fruit flies will pass many generations quickly, causing evolution to occur faster. The elephant only reproduces only once every five years, so that means the elephant will evolve slower.	3
637	Fruit flies will evolve faster, because if evolution takes 1000 generations, fruit flies will get there in less time that the elephants. It will take them fewer years.	3
638	Fruit flies will evolve more because there are more generations to make traits better.	3
639	Fruit flies will probably evolve faster because they have more chances of evolving because tghey have more offspring that can have the trait.	3
640	Fruit Flies will probably evolve faster because they reproduce faster than the elaphants do which means that there are more being born a yeaar so the traits are changing over time faster.	3
641	Fruit flies will reproduce faster because elephants reproduce slowly. It takes about 1,000 generations for the species to evolve, so it will take fruit flies about 28 years to evolve, whereas it will take elephants 200 years to evolve.	3
642	Fruit flies would evolve faster because evolution happens over many generations so while a fruit flies has 36 generations in a year the elephants have 5 generations in a year. Since fruit flies have more generations in a year they would evolve faster.	3
643	fruit flies would evolve faster because evolution takes place over about 1,000 generations. It would take about 28 years for fruit flies to evolve and elephants would evolve over about 5,000 generation, so the fruit flies would evolve faster.	3
644	Fruit flies would evolve faster because they produce more than the elephant	3
645	Fruit flies would evolve faster because they reproduce faster because elephants reproduce every 5 years.	3
646	Fruit flies would evolve faster because they reproduce quicker, so they can change quicker.	3
647	Fruit flies would evolve faster because they reproduce so much that there generations will go faster. They would be able to change more because they reproduce so much so there time goes by faster.	3
648	Fruit flies would evolve faster than Elephants because it takes many generations of a species to evolve, and since the Fruit Flies reproduce many more times than the Elephant, it would evolve faster.	3
649	Fruit flies would evolve faster, because there would be more and more generations which would each have new, and better traits.	3
650	Fruit flies would evolve more often because they have a generation faster so the evolve more often. Because they have a generation faster they change more often.	3
651	fruit flies would have had more generations in a smaller amount of time, therefore causing for more changes	3
652	Fruit flies would reproduce faster because they reproduce 36 times a year and they evolve over 1000 generations.	3
653	Fruit flies, because it takes 1000 generations to evolve, and fruit flies produce much faster than elephants , so their evolution time is shorter.	3
654	Fruit flies, they reproduce by the thousands and that means more generations which leads to evolution.	3
655	Fruit fly's have more babies then elephants.	3
656	fruit flyaEU(tm)s because they reproduce more them elephants do .	3
657	Fruit flyies because they reproduce way more times a year then elephants so they have a bigger chance of reproducing.	3
658	Fruit flys because they will reproduce so much they notice the bad things and fix them.	3
659	Fruit flys can produce more generations in an equal amount of time then a Elephants.	3
660	fruit flys die very quickly so they will evole	3
661	Fruit flys will defiantly evolve faster because the reproduction rate is much higher with the flys rather than the elephants. By the time an elefant has 5 generations the fruit fly will have thousands if not millions.	3
662	Fruit flys will evolve faster because they reproduce more times a year.	3
663	Fruit will evolve faster than elephants because they reproduce faster. I think that the faster a species reproduces, the faster it evolves or develops more traits.	3
664	fruitflies because they evolve wayyy faster than elaphants and each time they reproduce, they might change a little by gaining a diseiese or something. thats why there must be a lot of different types of fruitflies. Species i mean.	3
665	fruitflies because they reproduce wayyyy more than elephants and they'll probably change some of their features as well in the many years fruitflies have lived and reproduce.	3
666	frult flis reprodce more thin elephants because they ned more of there spices.	3
667	Fuit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster and can adapt to they're edviorment alot faster than the elephants who only reproduce i time every 5 years.	3
668	having many children increases the population of successfully evolved organisms that managed to survive for longer; therefore, evolution would move more quickly.	3
669	I believe fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce so much faster than elephants so that means when they gain traits to help them survive better it will go to the next generation so much faster.	3
670	I believe that every generation, the species is slowly changing. So the faster you reproduce, the faster change will come to the species which is basically what evolution is all about. So I think that fruit flies will evolve faster.	3
671	I believe that fruit flies will evolve faster because they are constantly reproducing, which is making more generations to keep going by, which is causing more changes in that time.	3
672	I believe that fruit flies will evolve faster since they have short life spans and they reproduce more frequently.	3
673	I believe that slower reproduction yields the rate of evolution. If their is more chance for variance in the genetic makeup the species will evolve much quicker.	3
674	I believe that the fruit flies evolve faster because organisms change when they are born not during their lifetime. Genetic traits are not passed down so the fruit fly has much more opportunites to evolve.	3
675	I believe the fruit flies will evolve faster because they repreduce more and that gives them a better change to evolve because the many babies will be able to change a lot.	3
676	I believe the fruit flies will evolve faster than the elephants because they have gone through more natural selection than the elephant.	3
677	I believe the fruit fly because if it reproduces 36 times every year, then it would have much more than the elephant, who would only be at 10 in year two.	3
678	I chose fruit flies because reproducing once every 5 years is very slow and that means fruit flies would of already evolved by then.	3
679	I chose fruit flies because they just keep reproducing and I think that every fruit fly might be a little different.	3
680	I chose fruit flies because they reproduce faster than elephants.	3
681	I chose fruit flies because they reproduce more then the Elephants and would evolve much faster because they reproduce 36 times a year.	3
682	I chose fruit flies because when offspring if born, it changes a little every time. So over time they fruit fly will change or evolve into something different.	3
683	I chose it because they can reproduce really fast so it is more likely to evolve faster	3
684	I chose the fruit flies beause they reproduce so much that they might have had some affect because the fruit flies change and work so much but the elephant just has a normal daily life for 5 years.	3
685	I picked that because it reproduces slower and will evolve faster because of that.	3
686	I picked the the fruit flies because they reproduce 36 times a year which is really fast compared to the elephants only reproduce once every five years.	3
687	I think elephants will evolve faster because elephants have a longer time to adapt. Even though fruit flies reproduce faster, elephants live way longer.	3
688	I think elephants will evolve faster because they will slowly decrease their population. Also,tey don't reproduce as much as the fruit flies.	3
689	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are having more offsprings.	3
690	I think fruit flies because it doesn't take that long to reproduce.	3
691	I think fruit flies because it seems like there would be a much lager chance of the fruit fly evolving faster if it reroduces faster since there are more chances of change.	3
692	I think fruit flies because it takes many generations to evolve and fruit flies reproduce much more so fruit flies would evolve faster.	3
693	I think fruit flies because the are smaller animals and they can produce faster than an elephant would.	3
694	I think fruit flies because the more you have reproducing each year, the more every year. In year 4, the elephants will have 20, while the flies have 144. That is a lot more than 20.	3
695	I think fruit flies because their are more of them. Because they reproduce about 36 time a year unlike elephants.	3
696	I think fruit flies because they are 36 tomes one year.	3
697	I think fruit flies because they have more babies. The more babies you have, the more variation there is.	3
698	I think fruit flies because they reproduce more often.	3
699	I think fruit flies because they reproduce way more than elephants do and they can have more fruit flies.	3
700	I think fruit flies because they're are more of them and there smaller.	3
701	I think fruit flies evolve fast because they are reproducing much more than the elephant and as the grow the will get new traits and evolve faster.	3
702	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they can inherit traits faster than elephants.	3
703	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they produce a greater amount of offspring then elephants.	3
704	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce more offspring than elephants do.	3
705	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce way faster than the elephants.	3
706	I think fruit flies reproduce faster because they produce 36 times a year and elephants only reproduce 5 times a year.	3
707	I think fruit flies will be faster since the fruit flies will be reproducing faster, but the elephant has less time for them to make different generations.	3
708	I think fruit flies will because they reproduce faster.	3
709	I think fruit flies will evolve fast because it produces more than the elephants.	3
710	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution takes many generations. The faster the reproduction rate, the faster they will evolve.	3
711	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because if a fruit fly changes very slightly, and all their offspring change the same amount, it will take less time for the change to develop into a large change. But if an elephant changed very slightly in it's lifetime, it would have to wait a long time before it had enough offspring to develop the change into a big difference.	3
712	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because in order to evolve, you have to reproduce. So if the flies reproduce faster, they can evolve faster.	3
713	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it has a faster rate of reproduction than the elephants.	3
714	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it reproduces more and it could change.	3
715	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because it reproduces more times a year that elephants.	3
716	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because of its rate of reproduction. Evolution will show the most after about 1000 generations and, based on the rate of reproduction, the fruit flies will reach 1000 generations faster.	3
717	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because since they reproduce more they adapt faster.	3
718	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because the faster a species reproduces, the faster it evolves. It takes one thousand generations for species to evolve, so it would take fruit flies only a few decades to evolve, while it would take elephants about 5 millenia to evolve.	3
719	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because the more you produce offspring, the more chances you have to evolve.	3
720	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because their is more and more populations being ade which makes it easier for the bugs to evolve, pass on their evolved DNA, then that bug will evolve a little and pass on their DNA very fast because of so many offspring.	3
721	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because their reproduction rate is faster. Evolution happens in 1000 generations and for fruit flies it only takes them around 28 years to achieve that while it takes an elephant 5000 years.	3
722	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because there is more generations that can change were elephants only have one every 5 years to change.	3
723	i think fruit flies will evolve faster because there is more of them producing and they will change over a period of time a lot faster because there is more of them	3
724	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because there is more of them, making it easier to evolve.	3
725	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are constantly reproducing and getting new mixes of genes each time.	3
726	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they are smaller and live a shorter life than elephants.	3
727	I think Fruit Flies will evolve faster because they produce more and there is more of them.	3
728	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce more than the elephant does (Fruit Flies: 36 times a year,While the elephant only reproduces 5 times a year) and they evolve faster because they have more of the insect then the elephant does to have more elephants.	3
729	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce more which means more offspring, more offspring means more fruit flies that will live.	3
730	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce more.	3
731	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce 36 times a year and will have more genetic variation faster then an elephant that reproduces once every five years.	3
732	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce about 36 times a year.	3
733	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster than the elephants so they can change faster.	3
734	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster, so they will evolve faster.	3
735	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster. The generations will come faster and change faster than elephants.	3
736	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more, so they have more of a chance of having something happen.	3
737	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce way more offspring than an elephant does and there would be more generations. The fruit flies might change a little bit every generation so they would probably evolve alot faster than an elephant would.	3
738	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they would have more variation.	3
739	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because with a higher birthrate that means there is a higher chance they can change.	3
740	I think fruit flies will evolve faster since it has more chances of dieing and they have more babies.	3
741	I think Fruit Flies will evolve faster than elephants because, the more you reproduce, the more changes will be found in the species.	3
742	I think fruit flies will evolve faster that elephants because evolution occcurs in generations, when a genetic difference happens had is passed onto its offspring.	3
743	I think fruit flies will evolve faster, since they produce more offspring and the traits will change more and evolve more.	3
744	I think fruit flies will evolve quicker because their life time is shorter.	3
745	I think fruit flies will more likely evolve faster because they reproduce more so then changes are more likely to occur within these times.	3
746	I think fruit flies will produce faster because they have more babies at a faster rate, so it gives them a higher change of evolving faster.	3
747	I think fruit flies will reproduce faster because they are making more offspring and then the offspring would all evolve faster than the elephants.	3
748	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because if they reproduce 36 times a year while elephants only reproduce about once every 5 years, the fruit flies would have more chances of evolving because they would keep reproducing and reproducing so they might have selective pressure which could make them faster other other circumstances in which they would need to evolve. If elephants only reproduce once every 5 years then it would take them a long time to evolve because they would not have many offspring.	3
749	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because the fruit flies would change in days and become different. But for elephants, they have a slower reproductive rate than fruit flies and it would take the elephant's offspring a longer time to evolve and change.	3
750	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because they are giving birth more which means each generation there is a very small change and if they made more babies a year they would evolve faster than elephants.	3
751	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because they have more chances to adapt or change in five years that an elephant would have.	3
752	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because they have more generations and they could evolve in a year or two but for elephants they only reproduce once in five years so they have to wait longer to evolve.	3
753	I think fruit flies would evolve faster because they would have more time to adapt than the elephant, if the world was slowly warming than the fruit flies would have a better chance of adapting quicker.	3
754	I think fruit flies would evolve faster if they reproduce more often than elephants.	3
755	I think fruit flies would go=row faster because they produce faster and in bigger numbers which would help alot	3
756	i think fruit flieswill evolve faster cause fruit flies reproduce faster	3
757	I think fruit flyes will evolve faster beacuse they produce faster	3
758	i think that fruit flies can evolve faster because the can reproduce faster and that gives them an advantage to be able to evolve faster.	3
759	I think that fruit flies evolve faster because they have more generations and evalution only accurs over thousand of years.	3
760	I think that fruit flies evolve faster than elephants because they have more babies so then their babies can evolve faster because they are being born more often.	3
761	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution takes place over generations and fruit flies create many generations in a short period of time when elephants create generations much slower.	3
762	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because it only takes 27 years for fruit flies to create 1,000 generations and evolve and for elephants it would take 5,000 years for them to evolve because of their slow rate of reproduction.	3
763	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because of its high population rate and also because of its size it would take a shorter period of time to evolve.	3
764	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because since they are always reproducing, they will pass by a lot of changes and evolve so they can survive better.	3
765	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more, so they have more of a chance to evolve; the faster an organism reproduces, the faster it evolves.	3
766	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because you need more offspring to reproduce since some will die and others will be successful and evolve for the better. Elephants on the other hand only reproduce once every five years so this does not give them enough offspring for evolution to occur.	3
767	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster due to the elephants lack of reproducing.	3
768	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster since they have short lifespans so their offspring will be able to fix it much more quickly than the first generation could. For example, it takes longer for adults to get used to new things such as technology whereas kids can easily adapt to new concepts.	3
769	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster, because since there would most likely be more fruit flies than elephants being born, evolution could effect them more, since there is a better chance of this to happen.	3
770	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster, because they are reproducing more and more, while their babies are also reproducing, adding to the fruit fly population.	3
771	I think that fruit flies will evolve quicker because they're are more and they are a smaller organism who will progress over time.	3
772	I think that fruit flies will reproduce faster because they reproduce faster. The reason that it would make a difference is because if the flies have faster generations then they will evolve faster	3
773	I think that fruit fly evolve faster because they reproduce more and they will have more generations faster.	3
774	I think that fruit fly's will evolve faster cause The have more generations every year than the elephant and therefor they can change faster.	3
775	I think that fruit flys evolve faster because they reproduse more so that there are more of them	3
776	I think that the fruit flies will because they produce more which gives them a better chance for change.	3
777	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because the new adaptions will be produced quicker since more off spring is produced.	3
778	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more offspring then the elephants.	3
779	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more which increases the chance of it changing.	3
780	I think that the fruit fly evolves faster because they reproduce more each year.	3
781	I think that the fruit fly will evolve faster because the fruit fly gets its generations much faster than the elephant.	3
782	I think that the fruit fly would evolve faster because they reproduce faster and change can occur faster.	3
783	I think the fruit flies because it has way more than elephants so it would change way faster.	3
784	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution happens over generations so the fruit fly will have more generations than the elephant over a couple of years.	3
785	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because if the Earth starts warming/cooling then it will have a better chance to adapt quicker.	3
786	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because in order to evolve, you have to reproduce so if the fruit flies are reproducing faster, then they can evolve faster.	3
787	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because they are constantly reproducing causing them to evolve faster than elephants who only reproduce about once every 5 years.	3
788	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because they easily have a better chance of getting different offspring because of the loads they reproduce a year. Also, a four-legged mammal as big as an elephant will obviously take more time to evolve considering the amount of area it carries.	3
789	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce faster than the elephant.	3
790	I think the fruit flies will evolve faster than the elephants because they reproduce faster.	3
791	I think the fruit flies will produce faster because they reproduce a lot more than elephants do.	3
792	I think the fruit flies would evolve faster because evolution takes about 1,000 generations to fully occur, and for the fruit flies, who reproduce about 36 times a year, that time would be much shorter that the elephants reproduction rate of once every 5 years.	3
793	I think the fruit flies would evolve faster because since it takes them 36 times a year to reproduce and elephant only reproduce once in 5 years. It's more likely that the fruit flies would evolve faster because it takes a animal to evolve 1000 generations. by the time the fruit flies evolve the elephant is probably only half through the process.	3
794	I think the fruit flies would evolve faster because since they reproduce faster, they could maybe change.	3
795	I think the fruit flies would evolve faster because they produce about 36 times a year compared to a elephant that reproduces about once every 5 years. So the chances of a fruit fly having more offspring is better than a chance of a elephant.	3
796	I think the fruit fly will evolve faster because first it is a insect and insects reproduce faster plus they lay a lot of eggs.	3
797	I think the fruit flys because they have a larger reproduction rate there for more chances to evolve to their environment.	3
798	I think the fruitflies would evolve faster because they need food they can't get so they evolve into something so maintain its living conditions.	3
799	I think the more times you reproduce, the more of a variation you are able to get.	3
800	I think they will evolve faster because since they reproduce so often, the newer generations could learn to adapt faster than the elephants because they only reproduce once every five years.	3
801	I think they will evolve faster because they are being produced more and have a higher chance.	3
802	i think they would evolve faster because the reproduce faster	3
803	I think this because if they reproduce faster then they evolve faster.	3
804	if a sp4ecies evolves every 1000 generations the faster you have kids the faster your species will evolve	3
805	if an organism repreduces faster than it has more chances to mix up the DNA and then that causes faster evolution.	3
806	If evolution takes thousands of generations to occur, the fruit fly would evolve much faster than the elephant because of the reduced time gap between reproduction.	3
807	if flies reproduce more they have more of a chance to change	3
808	if fruit flies have more offspring than there will be more chances to evlolve because there are many flies in the species unlike elaphants who have less animals in the species	3
809	if fruit flies produce about 36 babies a year, the babies are more likely to have other kids and those kids could mate with other organisms and produce different kinds of babies. while the elephant only reproduces about every once in 5 years, they probably wouldn't have a lot of variation.	3
810	If fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year they will evolve faster because there will be a bigger population in the species, but if elaphants only reproduce once every 5 years there are less elaphants in the species population so they will be less likely to evolve fast if at all. Elephants still can evolve it will just take much, much longer for them to evolve because of the time they reproduce.	3
811	If fruit flies reproduce more often than elephants, there's a larger chance they'll have offspring that will change their species.	3
812	if fruit flys reproduce faster they would have shorter generations so it would take less time for fruit flys to evolve	3
813	if fruitflies reproduce faster that gives them a chance to change more	3
814	If it takes roughly one thousand generations for a species to evolve then the fruitflies generations would go by faster leaving more oppertunituies for the species to evolve.	3
815	if reproduction goes faster than evolution is sped up.	3
816	If something reproduces more, there is more chance for evolution and more chance to make successful baby fruit flies.	3
817	If the flies die they start to produce more and elephants if a lot die they may not be able to reproduce	3
818	if there are 36 generations in one year there is a larger chance they will evolve	3
819	If they are constantly reproducing there a little changes every time, because the offspring isn't exactly the same as the parent. So evolution is more likely to happen faster to fruit flies.	3
820	If they reproduce faster there is more room for evolvment.	3
821	If they reproduce more often then there will be more fruit flies there for they will evolve fsster	3
822	if they reproduce more, that's more generations and more time to evolved	3
823	If they reproduce much quicker, they must evolve quicker too.	3
824	if you reproduce more then there is more time to chang over time because evolution occors throgh generations not years.	3
825	in 5 years the fruit fly has reproduce 180 times and the elephant only once or twice!	3
826	it is because fruilt flies rebrodis faster thin elphants.	3
827	It doesn't matter how long an organism takes to evolve, only the number of generations do. And since the fruit flies reproduce faster than the elephant, then they can probably make more generations than the elephants. Which results in the fact that the fruit flies will evolve faster than the elephant.	3
828	it evolves faster because it is a smaller specie	3
829	It is because evolution takes hundreds and maybe thousands of generations and since fruit flies reproduce faster, generations will happen faster so evolution will occur faster.	3
830	It is because it will go through generations faster.	3
831	it produces more than than the elephants	3
832	It says in the text that the fruit flys reproduce faster.	3
833	It ta3kes less time to get to 1000 generations if the animal produces more often; the fruit flies produce more often.	3
834	It takes 1,000's of generations to evolve so if the fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year and elephants only reproduce 5 times a year then the fruit flies would reproduce a lot faster.	3
835	it takes 1000 about 1000 generations to evolve it takes the fruit fly 27 years to evolve 200 years so the fruit fly will evovle faster	3
836	it takes 1000 generations , the faster they reproduce the faster evolution will happen.	3
837	It takes about 1,000 generations to evolve, and the fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year, so they will reach 1,000 generations faster than the elephant, which takes 5 years to reproduce once.	3
838	It takes about 1000 generations to see a change and so it would take less time for a fruit fly to evolve.	3
839	It takes about one thousand years for a species to evolve. Because fruit flies evolve 36 times a year, it will only take around 28 years to evolve. Elephants do that every five year, so it will take them roughly five thousand years to evolve.	3
840	It takes an animal 100 generations to evolve, so if a fruit fly reproduced more often than an elephant, the generations would go by a lot faster for the fruit fly.	3
841	It takes approximately a thousand generation for a little change to happen in a species (evolution) and the faster the species mates in a year the faster the species gets to a thousand generations and evolves.	3
842	it takes around 1000 generations for organisms to evolve. each time they reproduce they show small traits to show that they are evolving. each time they have an offspring, that is a new generation.	3
843	it takes lots of generations to evolve so if the fly reproduces 36 times a year it will evolve much faster then the elephant.	3
844	It takes many (1,000) generations for a species to evolve, so the more often the species reproduces, the more generations it will have in that time, and will shorten, or lengthen, the amount of time it takes for them to evolve.	3
845	It takes many generations for a species to evolve so the fruit fly will evolve faster. Say it takes 1000 generations for the fruit fly to evolve, that would only take about 28 years.	3
846	It takes offspring to evolve not years therefor when the fruit flies reproduce faster they will evolve faster.	3
847	It takes thousands of generations to evolve and if you reproduce more generations will go by faster.	3
848	it takes thousands of generations to evolve so the faster your reproduction the more generations you can produce. Therefor, the fruit flies with 36 times a year reproduction will evolve faster due to their fast reproduction rate giving more evolving chances.	3
849	It takes thousands of generations to evolve so the species that creates generations faster will evolve quicker.In this case the fruit flies are reproducing faster so they will evolve faster.	3
850	It takes4 about 1000 generations to see a real change in a species and because in one year there are 36 generations of fruit flies it will take less years than elephants that make another generation every 5 years. So, fruit flies will evolve a lot faster.	3
851	It think fruit flies will evolve faster because of its reproduction rate; if one fly is weird then its kids might be like it.	3
852	it will make the process faster if the organism can reproduce faster	3
853	It would take them less time to reach 1000 generations	3
854	more baby's the more chance of change	3
855	more chance because more offspring	3
856	More fruit flies get born causing it to get inherit more traits that cause it to get more fruit flies that evolve.	3
857	more generaions	3
858	more generations	3
859	more generations	3
860	More generations = More variety over time	3
861	More generations give more places to add new traits.	3
862	more generations will pass in a short period of time	3
863	more generations= faster evolution	3
864	More generations=More variety.	3
865	More offspring a year.	3
866	More offsprings are being produced.	3
867	More reproductions are occurring.	3
868	More they reproduce more they will get used to their environment to get used to things.	3
869	More traits are passed down instead of some offspring getting a trait and other with a different one	3
870	more variation occers amoung many generations	3
871	more variation of fruit flies could mean more evolution.	3
872	My answer is because they reproduce faster, they will evolve as a species.	3
873	Of course fruit flies because there are way more fruit flies because they reproduce more eggs than elephants and reproduce way more often	3
874	one fruit fly can prouduce more eggs than a elephant can prouduce elephants	3
875	One generation for a fruit fly goes super quick while an elephants generation take hundreds of years	3
876	Organisms can change in a few generations and since the fruit flies reproduce a lot then they have a higher chance of evolving.	3
877	Organisms evolve every 1000 generations, therefore fruit flies will only take a very, very short time to evolve because they produce so fast.	3
878	Organisms evolve over thousands of generations, not years. So if there are more generations per year for the fruit flies, they will evolve faster.	3
879	Over every generation a very slight variation occurs. So, if fruit flies reproduce 36 times a year more variation will happen then if you reproduce once every 5 years.	3
880	over generations, organisms change, to adapt to thier enviroment, and the fruit flies reproduce mmore, so that each generation changes little by litte.	3
881	Reproducing is how things evolve therefor if they reproduce more they evolve faster.	3
882	since a fruit fly reproduces more it must be quicker to evolve then the elephant it multiplies almost seven times as fast.	3
883	since evolution happens from generation to generation and fruit flies reproduce more, I think they will evolve faster.	3
884	Since evolution happens in generations and not over time the fly would evolve faster. It is a genetic prosses and since flies reproduce much quicker they would evolve faster.	3
885	Since evolution happens over many generations the faster the generations go by the faster evolution occurs.	3
886	Since evolution takes place in about one thousand generations and the fruit fly reproduces more often then the elephant making it have more generations, then the fruit fly could evolve faster.	3
887	Since flies live shorter, they have offspring faster, which means the species evolves faster because a million years for us may be a few dozen years for them.	3
888	Since fruit flies birth quicker, the flies' genes may evolve more and more with each generation.	3
889	Since Fruit Flies get reborn more often or faster they would change faster.	3
890	Since fruit flies reproduce faster its more likely for them to evolve faster	3
891	Since fruit flies reproduce faster, they will most likely evolve faster. It takes thousands of generations for evolution to happen, so the fruit flies will likely evolve faster.	3
892	Since fruit flies reproduce more frequently, their offspring are more likely to inherit different types of traits faster.	3
893	Since fruit flies reproduce more often they go through more generations which means they can evolve faster because they reproduce more and have generations go by quicker. On the other hand elephants that reproduce less often, have more time between generations. Since evolution is based on how many generations a species go through it takes longer for the elephant to evolve then the fruit fly.	3
894	Since fruit flies reproduce more often, each new fruit fly will gain a slightly better and new adaptation allowing them to eventually evolve.	3
895	Since fruit flies reproduce the most, there are more chances to evolve and different environments	3
896	Since fruit fly's reproduce faster and more often, they have a better chance at evolving faster.	3
897	Since it takes thousands of generations for a species to evolve, if there are more generations in a shorter amount of time, the species will evolve faster.	3
898	Since more are getting reproduced there will be more offsprings changing the fruit flies.	3
899	Since more fruit flies are produced per year, they have many generations to evolve.	3
900	Since the fruit flies reproduce faster each life of the fruit fly has a possibility to change a little while elephants have to wait once every five years.	3
901	Since there are more generations with the fruit flies because they reproduce more there would be more evolution.	3
902	Since they are reborn more often, they have more chances to change into a different animal.	3
903	since they reproduce 36 times per year they probably evolve 180 times faster	3
904	since they reproduce faster every one that is born comes out a little different.	3
905	Since they reproduce faster maybe some of the offspring will change in way when that baby has offspring they change from the orginal fruitfly into something different	3
906	Since they reproduce faster they will have more generations to evolve.	3
907	The ave more chances to evolve due to breeding amount.	3
908	The average time for evolution is 1000 years. If a fruit fly reproduces that much, it would take only a couple of years for that species to evolve. Elephants, however, would take around thousands of years to evolve.	3
909	The birthrate is faster than the deathrate for fruit flies.	3
910	The extra generations the fruit fly gets gives move chances to change faster.	3
911	The faster a species reproduce the faster it is for the species to evolve, and fruit flies reproduce faster than elephants do.	3
912	The faster a species reproduces, the faster it can evolve because it takes thousands of generations for evolution to occur.	3
913	The faster a species reproduces, the shorter it takes to evolve. It would take about 1,000 generations for a species with 1/year reproduction rate to evolve. if you divide that by 36, which is 27.77, you will see that it only takes about 27.77 years for a fruit fly to evolve. Elephants though, would take 5 times longer to evolve because they reproduce only once every 5 years, so it would take them 5000 years to evolve.	3
914	the faster generations pass, the more evolution occurs.	3
915	The faster the rate of reproduction, the faster a species will evolve. The fruit flies reproduce faster, so they will evolve faster.	3
916	The faster the species reproduces the faster it will hit 1000 generations which is the time you would be able to see a deference because of evolution.	3
917	The faster they reproduce the faster they will know which traits are needed to survive.	3
918	the fru3it flies reproduce more, therefore more chances for mutation, faster.	3
919	The fruit flies are faster because they produce faster.	3
920	The fruit flies are having more generations so their would be more chances to evolve from parent to child.	3
921	The fruit flies can pass down their traits more frequently, which would mean a trait would develop before the elephants.	3
922	The fruit flies could keep reproducing and evolving a lot faster because they can reproduce about three times a month.	3
923	The fruit flies evelove faster because there are nore generations being produced every year an more generations.	3
924	The fruit flies have 36 generations in one year while elephants have one generation in five years. The more generations, the more you evolve.	3
925	The fruit flies have many more generations than the elephant.	3
926	The fruit flies have many more generations to evolve so the fruit flies will evolve much faster.	3
927	the fruit flies must learn to reproduce quickly with so many more numbers,not to mention predaters, and there is an increased chance of deformaties amoung them that change their speies	3
928	The fruit flies produce more letting traits evolve faster.	3
929	The fruit flies reproduce 36 times every year instead of once every 5 years.	3
930	The fruit flies reproduce a lot more. In a year fruit flies produce 36 times a year and elephants reproduce about once every five years.	3
931	The fruit flies reproduce more at a time.	3
932	The fruit flies reproduce over a shorter amount of time than elephants so they will be able to go through generations quicker and also go through naturals selection quicker.	3
933	The fruit flies will evolve and grow faster because of more reproduction.	3
934	The fruit flies will evolve faster because of the more times they reproduce but they would die faster because insects don't have a very long life span.	3
935	The fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce faster so it will have more time to change	3
936	The fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce a lot more than the elephants. Since fruit flies reproduce more, they can evolve a lot faster then elephants.	3
937	The fruit flies will evolve faster because when an animal begins to evolve it takes many life cycles for the process to be complete.	3
938	The fruit flies will have more generations and will adapt faster.	3
939	The fruit flies will have more offspring with different adaptions so they can be helped in their environment. Since there are more fruit fly offspring than elephants, this will allow for the fruit fly to more rapidly evolve.	3
940	The fruit flies will keep on evolving with new abilities. They also reproduce more often so they can keep changing.	3
941	The fruit flies will reproduce faster and be more likely to evolve before the elephants do.	3
942	The fruit flies will reproduce faster because the more you reproduce, the more generations their will be. Also, the more generations there are the better chance they have of evolving.	3
943	the fruit flies would evolve faster because the breed a lot faster than the elephants.	3
944	The fruit flies would have more generations for the evolution of fruit flies, as in each generation it starts to change and change until it changes not fully but changes a lot.	3
945	The fruit flies' generation is quicker so they get to one thousand quicker.	3
946	The fruit fly may have two babies but it reproduced much faster than an elephant.	3
947	The fruit fly population would evolve faster because it reproduces faster than the elephant population.	3
948	The fruit fly reproduces 36 times a year which is way faster than once every 5 years.	3
949	The fruit fly will evolve faster because if they produce more often then their will be more generations and evolution happens within 1000 generations.	3
950	The fruit fly will evolve faster because their is more generation.	3
951	The fruit fly will evolve faster because they have a higher reproductive rate so that adaptations will pass on faster.	3
952	The fruit fly will have more generations per year	3
953	the generations come faster so they would evolve faster	3
954	The generations will be shorter and occur more often, so it will evolve faster.	3
955	The more a specie reproduce the faster they will evolve.	3
956	The more a species reproduce the faster each generation takes to form, making evolution faster.	3
957	the more a spices reproduces the faster it evolves because the changes happen every generation	3
958	The more an organism reproduces the faster that organism will evolve	3
959	The more chances you have to reproduce, the more chances those babies will evolve where they live and then their babies will do, and so on.	3
960	The more generations a species creates, the more chances for that species to have small things change over time.	3
961	The more generations of an species you have, the faster time it takes to evolve.	3
962	The more generations the faster something will evovle. It takes many generations and in two year the fruit flies will have 72 generation while the elephants will only have 10 genrations.	3
963	The more offspring you have the more evolution happens.	3
964	the more organisms the higher chance of evolution	3
965	The more production the faster the evolution	3
966	the more reproduction means more variation and a higher chance of evolving to occur.	3
967	The more reproduction the faster the traits can be born.	3
968	The more the animals reproduce the faster they evolve so the fruit fly has more chances of evolving since it reproduces so much.	3
969	the more they reproduse and have more babies while the world is changing, they might change into something else	3
970	the more times you have kids the more generations are formed so in 5 years elefants have one generation but in 5 years fruit flies have 180 genertations.	3
971	The more you reproduce the faster you are to evolve and changes will happen quicker.	3
972	the more(faster) generations and offspring they make, the faster they will evolve.	3
973	The population is much bigger.	3
974	the produce lots more offspring a lot faster than the elephants could	3
975	The rate of reproduction widely affects the speed of evolution. It takes approximately 1000 years for a species to evolve, if elephants reproduce once every 5 years then it will take 5000 years to evolve. While on the other hand a fruit fly will only take approximately 28 years.	3
976	The reason is that since they are small and reproduce faster and their are so many variations it is easier to reproduce.	3
977	The reproduce faster.	3
978	the reproduce more often	3
979	The reproduce more often than elephants	3
980	the reproducetion rate is much faster than the elephants and evolution happens every thousand generation its most likely to evolve in lesser years than the elephant	3
981	The reproducing rate is mostly where you might see differences in the evolution of the organism. since the fruit fly reproduces faster the evolution may be quicker.	3
982	The3 fruit flies reproduce many more times a year because the process is much quicker.	3
983	Their generations go faster so traits can evolve faster.	3
984	There are more chance of flies because there are more flies.	3
985	"There are more chances to adapt and pass on genetic ""advice"" with fruit flies than elephants"	3
986	There are more generations in fruit flies than elephants, so they will go faster.	3
987	There is a greater chance of change in Fruit flies because of how many are produced.	3
988	There will be so many fruit flies in such a short time.	3
989	there would be more genorations and it takes about a thousand genorations for a animal (or bug) to evolve	3
990	theres more of them	3
991	They are more fruitflies than elephants	3
992	They are more likely to produce an offspring with a mutation. They also have more genetic variation, and are more likely to survive when change comes.	3
993	They breed faster and could have evolved offspring.	3
994	They breed faster so they change faster	3
995	they can produce more and quicker	3
996	they die faster	3
997	they dont live as long and have more generations faster	3
998	They evolve faster because there are more.	3
999	They evolve so much that I think that they will have more time to evolve than the elephant.	3
1000	They evolve the same rate each reproduction, except since fruit flies reproduce faster, so the whole species will evolve faster.	3
1001	they get many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many more chances to reproduce and then change just a little each time.	3
1002	They go through generations a lot quicker.	3
1003	They have a faster chance of evolving because they reproduce faster.	3
1004	they have a shorter life and evolved faster	3
1005	they have a shorter life span and so generatons go by faster	3
1006	they have babies more	3
1007	they have children more frequently.	3
1008	They have many more generations to change their genes so they would evolve faster.	3
1009	they have more babies	3
1010	They have more babies so they have a better chance of changing faster.	3
1011	they have more chance to reproduce, so they have a better chance of finding a useful trait.	3
1012	They have more food to obtain and fruit fly's die in two days	3
1013	They have more generations to evolve than the elephant which would take longer to evolve.	3
1014	They have more generations to evolve.	3
1015	They have more generations which will create new traits.	3
1016	They have more life times to evolve.	3
1017	they have more offspring and each one evolves more	3
1018	They have more offspring and it will be faster.	3
1019	They have more offspring so their is a better chance of some of those offspring having a good chance of getting life helping traits.	3
1020	They have more offspring, so they will change faster.	3
1021	they have more offsprings and they can differ more and change faster	3
1022	They live a shorter life span and reproduce faster letting them have more offspring with more diverse traits.	3
1023	THEY MAKE BABIES FASTER.	3
1024	they make more	3
1025	They pass traits more often.	3
1026	they produce all the time so offspring is a lot faster and the average fruit fly lives up to a week so yes the fruit flies evolve faster then the elephants.	3
1027	They produce faster.	3
1028	they produce more	3
1029	They produce more each year which makes different genes and they will evolve faster.	3
1030	They produce more offspring making more babies.	3
1031	They produce more quickly so there is a more likly chance that something could change and cause a evolution with fruit flies.	3
1032	they produce more times than the elephant, giving fruit flies a better chance to change.	3
1033	They produce more.	3
1034	they r3eproduce faster	3
1035	they reduce more	3
1036	they repoduce much, much more than elephants	3
1037	they reproduce a lot faster and it takes a species 1000 generations to evolve so they would then evolve a lot faster	3
1038	They reproduce faster making, giving them more generations and more variation.	3
1039	They reproduce faster so there are more offspring to evolve.	3
1040	They reproduce faster which means there is more likely a chance of change in the offspring.	3
1041	they reproduce faster, so they evolve faster. this is because they will encounter predators that will be hard to escape.	3
1042	They reproduce faster.	3
1043	they reproduce many times.	3
1044	they reproduce more	3
1045	they reproduce more	3
1046	They reproduce more every year so they would have more generations to evolve.	3
1047	They reproduce more often so they take less time to evolve.	3
1048	They reproduce more so there is more chance of variation.	3
1049	they reproduce more, therefore giving them more of giving them more opportunitys to reproduce	3
1050	They reproduce more, which means they can get different characteristics faster, and evolve quicker.	3
1051	They reproduce more.	3
1052	They reproduce so quickly, so they learn new adaptations quickly.	3
1053	they reproduce way faster than elephants reproduce	3
1054	they will be so many fruit flies in such a short time.	3
1055	They will be so many fruit flies in such short time.	3
1056	They will change a little every time the reproduce.	3
1057	they will evolve faster because they produce a lot faster so there offspring has a lot of time to evolve before the elephants evolve	3
1058	They will go through more generations faster than elephants.	3
1059	They will have more babies and more chance for evolution to take place.	3
1060	They wold change faster because they have more offspring in a shorter amount of time.	3
1061	This is because they are being produced a lot faster.	3
1062	Well if the fruit flies have more generation than the elephant then the fruit flies have times to add in new useful traits.	3
1063	well they reproduce faster and have more babys then the elephant	3
1064	when more and more fruit flies are born they evolve faster because they send off their traits into thier offspring.	3
1065	With a faster rate of birth there is more variation in population, allowing natrual selection to take place.	3
1066	With more generations the slight changes can occur faster.	3
1067	A creature changes a tiny bit in each generation, so the more generations, the more change. If fruit flies are always dying and reproducing, the unhealthy ones are likey to die much sooner.	4
1068	A species needs to evolve over many generations, not just a few, and the fire flies produce offspring faster, so they can evolve more quickly because it takes less time to produce offspring that will inherit their traits.	4
1069	beacuse fruit flies reproduce faster so that the offspring inheiret the traits faster and pass them down faster.	4
1070	Becaus emore generations equal more variation eventually leading to evolution	4
1071	Because fruit flies have a larger amount of offspring there could be more variations in the children and thus a faster and bigger change for evolution to take place. But I think evolution is already taking place in organisms like the fruit flies so there is just a faster way for fruit flies to evolve.	4
1072	Because if you create a new generation 36 times a year, than there is a better chance that there will be more variation.	4
1073	Because since fruit flies populate faster and live faster, there is more of a chance that they would evolve faster based on the amount of variety there is in all the offspring.	4
1074	because the more generations the more time the organism has to evolve because organisms can't evolve in one generation so the more generations the fruit fly can develop more traits.	4
1075	because they are born faster so their is more adaptations over time	4
1076	because they have more babies for a more variation, it is rare to have variation but it is more common if there is more oppurtunity to have it.	4
1077	Due to the fact that flies reproduce so quickly a mutation may occur that is passe on and a evolutionar trait can be passed on faster thus any flies that dont have the power will be taken out although chances are that the ones with the trait will die quickly and the trait will disapear.	4
1078	each time a fruit fly reproduces, different genetic copies will be made, and more and more different genetic copies will be transferred. This way the fruit flies with the best traits will be able to reproduce the most and pass on their genetic genes.	4
1079	Evolution happens over many generations, not a lifetime. The more a species reproduces, the more variation there will be and the more chances it will have to adapt to possible changes in their environment.	4
1080	Evolution happens when you reproduce so if you reproduce 36 times a years more genes will get passed on and they will have different traits but still evolve from the same thing.	4
1081	Evolution occurs over the generations, and if there are more generations in a year, then the adaption happens more quickly.	4
1082	Evolution occurs through reproduction (the two parents pass down their traits to their offspring), and the more an organism reproduces, the quicker the species can evolve, because the genes need to get mixed up enough times for evolution to occur. Since fruit flies reproduce more often than elephants, the fruit flies will definitely evolve quicker than the elephants.	4
1083	Evolution takes many generations, so the more offspring to be born the faster they inherit their parents traits and evolve.	4
1084	"Evolution takes many generations. However, a fruit fly's generation is much much shorter than an elephant's generation. If a trait takes 1000 generations to evolve for both fruit flies and elephants, fruit flies will ""finish"" evolving first because their generations are much shorter."	4
1085	Fruit flies are able to pass genes onto their offspring faster, thus creating a larger population with a new trait sooner.	4
1086	fruit flies are being born and dieing faster than the elephant.	4
1087	Fruit flies because traits that are given to offspring can be passed down faster due to the amount of generations there are.	4
1088	Fruit flies evolve faster because they reproduce faster and more often so there is a faster rate for evolution and new species to evolve.	4
1089	Fruit flies have more chance to have variation therefore enabling a higher chance to change if the variation makes that fly's life easier to live in the environment.	4
1090	Fruit flies have more chances to gain new traits, so they evolve faster.	4
1091	Fruit flies have more generations than elephants in a year. Changes happen over generations when offspring inherit traits that are useful on their lives. Of there are more generations in a year, they evolve faster. Hence, fruit flies evolve faster than elephants.	4
1092	Fruit flies have more oppurtunities with their many offsping to vary and evolve.	4
1093	Fruit flies produce faster so their developed traits will be passed on faster than the traits of elephants to their offspring.	4
1094	Fruit flies produce more organisms which become more different than older generations each time so they have a better chance of becoming different faster than an elephant.	4
1095	Fruit flies will be able to evolve faster because they have more offsprings that can have the good traits they want and then all the flies without the good traits will die. The elephant won't produce as many offsprings as the fruit flies so it only have less chances than the fruit flies to get the good traits in an offspring.	4
1096	Fruit flies will evolve faster because 1000 generations will pass first. If they reproduce more, natural selection is sped up. According to nature, if they reproduce faster, natural selection is sped up, meaning fruit flies have shorter life times. Since they reproduce a lot, if they lived longer, there would be too much selective pressure for competition, it would be overcrowded with flies everywhere, and they would all die. We know this by observation. The fruit flies that are weak will die faster, because natural selection will speed up. This is why they evolve faster.	4
1097	Fruit flies will evolve faster because more generations pass by in less time, allowing the flies to adapt more.	4
1098	Fruit Flies will evolve faster because they can produce more offsprings and the offsprings can have the good trait they will help them survive and they will pass it on to their offsprings and so on.	4
1099	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they can take on traits and adapt quicker.	4
1100	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more offspring. They would have more chances of changing because there is more offspring. Elephants, however, have less children, so the changes would happen A LOT more slowly.	4
1101	fruit flies will evolve faster because they produce more and the more they produce the more traits they'll pass down which will cause them to evolve faster	4
1102	Fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce much more and they might have to adapt to their envronment faster.	4
1103	Fruit Flies will evolve faster, because if offspring is reproducing while their parents till are, the population will grow. The current offspring ill e able to use the acquired and inherited traits that they were given at birth.	4
1104	Fruit flies will probably evolve faster than elephants, because elephants produce less offspring than fruit flies. Fruit flies produce 180 more times than a elephant reproduces. They flies have more offspring so they have more genetic variation, so there is a better chance to evolve.	4
1105	Fruit flies will reproduce and evolve faster because they have more babies and have a more chance of being different.	4
1106	Fruit flies would evolve faster because throughout each generation, variation would occur, developing differences in those fruit flies. Also, if they reproduce 36 times a year and it takes about 1000 generations for a clear difference in evolution, it would take fruit flies about 28 years to completely evolve, while it takes an elephant 5000 years to completely evolve.	4
1107	fruit fly's breed faster and because genes are affected from the environment i think they would be able to evolve if there was a problem because they would change faster to better suit their environment changing.	4
1108	I believe that if the fruit fly reproduces more than there is a better chance of a new trait that could make them evolve	4
1109	I contend that fruit flies will evolve faster because they are producing much more offspring that will have variation and will evolve faster because there are more of them being born in less time.	4
1110	I think fruit flies evolve faster because they produce faster than elephants. their traits will be passed down faster than the traits of an elephant does.	4
1111	I think fruit flies evolve faster than elephants because they have more offspring causing the babies to evolve and adapt.	4
1112	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution occurs when an organism has a difference in its genes, and it gets passed down to its offspring.	4
1113	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because if their are more generations than they can have selective pressure kill the ones with less advantages and the next generations would get more and more advantages.	4
1114	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because the faster it reproduces, the faster it will evolve. The more variety brings quicker evolution.	4
1115	I think Fruit flies will evolve faster because the population is high so they will inherit traits faster.	4
1116	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because there are more offspring to allow for change and adaptions to occur.	4
1117	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because there are much more of them than elephants, and they will get a chance to experience the environment and adapt changes to help them survive.	4
1118	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce way faster than elephants and they can pass on new traits quicker.	4
1119	I think fruit flies will evolve faster than elephants because they reproduce about 36 times a year and elephants only reproduce one every five years so fruit flies will gets their parents traits much faster.	4
1120	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster because the flies with unnecessary traits will die faster and the good traits will be passed on many times a year, while elephants will only do that every 5 years. Also, since it takes around a thousand generations to evolve, fruit flies will have a thousand generations in much less time. Natural selection will happen a lot faster with the fruit flies than elephants.	4
1121	I think that fruit flies will evolve faster then elephants because they produce more then an elephant and the fruit flies probably adapt easier then the elephant	4
1122	I think that fruit flies would evolve faster because evolution happens over many generations. The faster it reproduces the faster the generations are made. The more generations, the more traits it will begin to have. Elephants won't evolve faster because of how slow it reproduces and the generations are going slower.	4
1123	I think that fruit flies would evolve faster because it has more variation wich would lead to evolution and it takes about 1000 generations to evolve so it would take the elephant around 5000 years to evolve while it would only take the fruit flies around 27 years	4
1124	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because it takes thousands of generations to evolve, and the more offspring there is, the faster the variation can happen.	4
1125	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more and so they can probably pass down traits more times per generation.	4
1126	I think that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce much more. According to Darwin's Theory of Evolution, it says that overproduction is needed for evolution to occur. This is so that some can die off and others can successfully evolve or create variation in the species. The fruit flies reproduce so much that the fast overproduction will lead to evolution of the fruit flies.	4
1127	I think that the fruit flys would evolve faster because they have offsrping so much that their offsprings may come out different which would cause more evolving species to come and with more and more different species, the entire population would eventually change.	4
1128	If fruit a producing more generations per year , the fruit flies will pass on their traits to the next generation faster than the elephant. The bad ones will die off quicker.	4
1129	If fruit flys reproduce at a much faster rate it will have more chances that that one trait the parent had and no one else had to be past on to the next generation and that baby will mate and have a fly with that trait and one trait that is individual to that. But only the flies with good traits will survive to mate with others. And over time it will evolve so you can notivce it but if you look at elephants they haven't change much from their ancestor the mammoth.	4
1130	If one fruit fly inherits a trait that helps it to survive, then that trait can be passed on to its children, who may inherit that trait. Since fruit flies reproduce so much more than elephants, the good traits will be passed on more quickly.	4
1131	It is because fruit flies die more often and faster so the ones who live will give that trait to the offspring and then sooner or later the whole species will survive longer.	4
1132	It takes many generations for a species to evolve and have certain traits, so the fruit flies can reproduce quickly so they can evolve quickly, whereas the elephants take a long time to reproduce, so they take a long time to evolve.	4
1133	It takes many generations to pass traits to the offspring with a noticeable and helpful difference so the fruit flies would evolve faster.	4
1134	Since fruit flies reproduce faster, there is more variation in the species because of all the things they do in their lifetime. Since evolution takes thousands of generations, and the fruit flies have already gone through many of them because of their reproduction speed, they are more likely to evolve faster than elephants.	4
1135	Since they reproduce more, the more genetic traits will be created over time and they will be passed down to their offspring.	4
1136	So many generations can make evolution faster because the generations can adapt faster to the generation and quickly give it to its offspring.	4
1137	The faster an organism reproduces the faster the species evolves because it will inherit features quicker.	4
1138	The fruit flies evolve quicker because they reproduce much quicker then elephants and produce more offspring due to this they often get adapted to the environment and are able to survive.	4
1139	The fruit flies have more offspring than the elephants so their adaptations it would be more likely to be able to breed true [through].	4
1140	The fruit flies would evolve faster because they are smaller than the elephant and the fruit fly reproduces faster which means a adaptation will come up faster than the elephant.	4
1141	the fruit fly will reproduce faster so more chances a good trait will catch on and change all the fruit flys.	4
1142	The higher the reproduction rate the more chance of variation in population. Since fruit flies reproduce more per year, they are more likely going to have more variation in population than elephants who only reproduce every 5 years.	4
1143	The more generations an organism has in a time span, the faster it can evolve. The more generations it has, new traits can be used and disused, resulting in evolution.	4
1144	The more generations the traits may show more and evolution will take place faster.	4
1145	The more something evolves more their species would have change to occur because if they reproduce quickly they can have more variations in their offspring which will result in evolution occurring earlier for the fruit flies.	4
1146	the more something reproduces the faster the different traits can be past on	4
1147	the more that a population reproduces, the more variation that there will be. variation is important to evolution because there is a better chance of survival of a species if a virus or something kills all the flies with a certain trait, then the others without that trait will live on.	4
1148	The more the generations, the faster traits will change.	4
1149	the more times a speciies reproduces the more the population has a chance of evolving becuase the species has more variation and can pass natural tests and natural selection.	4
1150	The reason I believe fruit flies would evolve faster is because they have offspring more frequently so if they have a good trait then it will be passed down through generations faster.	4
1151	The reason I chose fruit flies is because if a fly that has a good trait produces 36 offspring the trait gets passed on to 36 new flies.	4
1152	The`re would be more of the species to evolve. If the fruit flies were evolving, the new adaptation would come faster through more generations. The elephant has less generations to pass down the new trait.	4
1153	Theirs more baby's which means more variation.	4
1154	There is a more likely chance that the fruit flies will evolve faster because they reproduce more often. Each generation has variation and the because of that the fruit flies offspring will be different. When their offspring reproduces about 13140 times the elephants will have reproduce once.	4
1155	There is more chance of variation, the more offspring there are and the more chance of variation means more chance of evolving.	4
1156	there would be variation in every single generation and they all go through natural selection that selects out individuals that suit the environment. There would be 1800 generations of fruit flies in 5 years while elephants only have two. So fruit flies could evolve faster than elephants and have a lot more chance of surviving once the environment changes.	4
1157	They give birth to more offspring so they will obtain traits faster than the elephant.	4
1158	They have more offspring causing the babies to adapt and evolve.	4
1159	They reproduce 52.5 times as fast as elephants, letting the species adapt and pass down helpful traits much more quickly.	4
1160	They reproduce a lot so, there is a lot more chances that a mutation comes up. Elephants only reproduce one every five years so, there is a smaller chance that a mutation will come.	4
1161	They reproduce faster so if there's a little change in the environment that has a big effect, they'll catch it and adapt to it so they will reproduce more and match the environment.	4
1162	they reproduce more often and so they can evolve quicker because there would be a variation in the flys, such as some might not be able to fly well or they have small wings and will get eaten, but the ones that have big wings can fly quick and reproduce an evolved species.	4
1163	they reproduce more so they'll have more offspring to adapt with different traits	4
1164	They will have more offspring, giving it a greater chance of a fruit fly adapting and producing more offspring.	4
1165	When a species reproduces more, it give them a faster time for evolution to occur. Very subtle changes happen in every offspring. If fruit flies reproduce more often than elephants, they will have a faster evolution and a better chance to adapt or change.	4
1166	When more offspring are produced more traits will be passed on quicker.	4
1167	when the flys produce offspring, every time they are giing the new traits which enables them to evolve quicker than elephants.	4
1168	With a higher reproduction rate a trait that could help one fly survive could be passed on to hundreds of the other flies over the time of a couple of years.	4
1169	With more generations are being reproduced, the will evolve faster because they will pass down their traits faster.	4
1170	Because fruit flies have many ,many more generations at a time they have a better chance at passing on successful traits, so they will be adapted for their environment sooner.	5
1171	because the more times a speices reproduce the more the variation in the speices.The more variation in the speices the better it adapts to new things.The faster it adapts to new things the faster it evolves.	5
1172	Due to the faster breeding time of the fruit fly, I believe that the flies will produce much more variation, as well as the need to adapt, due to whatever reason they need.	5
1173	Evolution occurs when organisms with traits best suited for the environment pass on these adaptations to their children, and eventually (many generations later), the species will be better suited for the environment as a whole. So, the more a species reproduces, the faster it can evolve. This being said, the fruit fly will evolve much faster than the elephant.	5
1174	Evolution occurs when, over at least a thousand generations, organisms with genetic traits more suited to the selective pressures placed on them (such as lack of food) are more likely to survive to reproduce and pass these advantageous traits down to their offspring, so the faster generations happen, the faster evolution happens.	5
1175	Fruit flies reproduce more times so genetic traits can be passed down quicker. Also,if there is a sudden change in the environment, the fruit flies can evolve quicker and adapt to the environment faster.	5
1176	Fruit flies reproduce more times so genetic traits can be passed down quicker. Also,if there is a sudden change in the environment, the fruit flies can evolve quicker and adapt to the environment faster.	5
1177	I think fruit flies will evolve faster because they have more chances to be a variant with different traits. Also they will have more chances to adapt to the environment.	5
1178	The fruit flies will evolve faster because evolution is based off of natural selection which happens in every generation. With every generation, some organisms (the organisms withe the less beneficial genetic traits) will die off and some organisms (the ones with the more beneficial starting genetic traits) will survive and be able to reproduce. Evolution is generally very slow and will take many generations. The more generations you can cram into a given time, the more natural selection happens and thus the faster evolution happens.	5
